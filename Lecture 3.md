## The tradition of common law

### Precedents

Much of criminal law, as well as the legal process in general, is based on precedent. This means that judicial decisions made in similar cases in the past serve as a guide for current cases. These precedents are preserved over time through court records and are documented in collections of case law, such as yearbooks and reports.

> The "yearbooks" referred to in the context are collections of legal cases and decisions that were historically documented and compiled over the years. These yearbooks typically contain summaries or reports of significant legal rulings and judicial decisions made in various courts during specific time periods. They serve as valuable resources for legal practitioners, scholars, and historians, providing insights into the development of legal principles, precedents, and the evolution of the law over time. Each yearbook is typically organized chronologically, allowing users to trace the progression of legal thought and jurisprudence within a given jurisdiction.
>
> Yearbooks of legal cases and decisions are typically published by legal publishers, academic institutions, or professional organizations specializing in law. These publishers compile and curate relevant cases from various court proceedings and legal sources, and then organize them into volumes or editions for publication. Examples of publishers known for producing legal yearbooks include Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, Thomson Reuters, and LexisNexis. Additionally, some governmental bodies or judicial institutions may also publish official reports or compilations of legal cases within their jurisdictions.

The precedents to be applied in the decision of each new case are determined by the presiding judge, which means that the judges play an enormous role.

### Statutes

In addition to case law, common law systems also include codified written laws. In countries that follow the common law system, the parliament passes laws that are written down, known as statutes. These laws cover various aspects of legal matters, such as defining criminal acts.

Statute law defines specific rights and defenses, such as safeguarding individual freedoms. In a representative system, elected officials vote on behalf of the people to ensure the protection of individual freedoms. It's a legal framework that strengthens human rights by outlining the definition of various offenses.

Statutes are elements that are given by law so that judges are able to determine what has been done.

The common law system is made up of statutory law and case law. Case law is more important here than in civil law systems, but statute law remains at the center.

### Judges

In the civil law system, the judge adheres to the statutory law, while in the common law system, the judge is in charge of following the precedents, and a good deal of case law has been built up to assist the judge in the interpretation of statutory codes. In the common law system, the statutory law is a frame, and the judge is more active during the trial.

During the trial, the judge has the responsibility of safeguarding both the rights of the accused and the interests of the public in the administration of criminal justice. Even the rights of the other party are important to protect.

According to what is called "**due process of law**,"  during the trial, the judge is responsible for checking that all systems are in order. The mission of the judge is to use some general principles, apply them to the concrete cases, and merge these principles with what is written inside the statutory law.

> "==Due process of law==" is a fundamental legal principle that ensures fair treatment and procedural justice in legal proceedings. It requires that government actions adhere to established legal procedures and respect the rights of individuals, particularly in matters involving life, liberty, or property. The concept originated in English common law and has been enshrined in various legal systems around the world, including the United States.
>
> Key aspects of due process include:
>
> 1. **Notice**: Individuals must be informed of the legal proceedings and the charges or claims against them.
>
> 2. **Opportunity to be Heard**: Individuals must have the opportunity to present their case, respond to allegations, and defend their interests before an impartial decision-maker.
>
> 3. **Fair and Impartial Adjudication**: Legal proceedings must be conducted fairly and impartially by neutral judges or decision-makers.
>
> 4. **Legal Standards and Rules**: Decisions must be based on established legal standards, rules, and evidence, rather than arbitrary or capricious actions.
>
> 5. **Right to Legal Representation**: Individuals have the right to legal representation and assistance in navigating the legal process.
>
> 6. **Protection Against Arbitrary Government Actions**: Due process serves as a safeguard against arbitrary government actions, ensuring that government powers are exercised within the bounds of law and respect for individual rights.
>
> Overall, due process of law is essential for upholding the rule of law, protecting individual rights, and promoting fairness and justice in legal proceedings. It applies in various contexts, including criminal prosecutions, civil lawsuits, administrative hearings, and governmental actions affecting individuals' rights and interests.

Example: the Miranda system, a type of notification customarily given by police to criminal suspects in police custody. When someone is under arrest, the police officers have an obligation to inform them of their right to silence and, in effect, protection from self-incrimination; that is, their right to refuse to answer questions or provide information to law enforcement or other officials. Police officers may also give suspects a card with Miranda warning printed on it.

> The specific wording of the Miranda warning can vary slightly depending on jurisdiction and law enforcement agency, but it generally includes the following standard elements:
>
> "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?"
>
> This text informs individuals of their rights to remain silent, have an attorney present during questioning, and to stop questioning at any time. It also asks individuals whether they understand their rights and if they wish to waive or invoke them during police questioning.

*The Miranda warning is named after the U.S. Supreme Court´s decision in Miranda v. Arizona in 1966. In the original case, the defendant, Ernesto Miranda, was arrested in Phoenix, Arizona, in March 1963, based on circumstantial evidence linking him to the kidnapping and rape of a young woman. During police interrogation, Miranda confessed to the crimes after about two hours of questioning. However, Miranda was not informed of his rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.*

*At trial, Miranda's confession was presented as evidence, leading to his conviction. However, his defense attorney argued that the confession should be excluded from evidence because Miranda had not been informed of his constitutional rights before confessing. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.*

*On June 13, 1966, the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona. The Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination required law enforcement officers to inform individuals of certain rights before conducting custodial interrogations. These rights included the right to remain silent and the right to consult with an attorney. Because Miranda had not been informed of these rights before confessing, the Court ruled that his confession was inadmissible as evidence.*

The Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination is the right to remain silent, which is the right to refuse to answer questions or to otherwise communicate information.

> No person shall be ... nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...

The Sixth Amendment right to counsel means that the suspect has the right to consult with an attorney before questioning begins and to have an attorney present during the interrogation.

> In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to ... and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.

The right of the defendant exists in all administrative systems. This Miranda warning was born in the US, but nowadays the general principle regarding the defendant’s rights exists in all western countries and some other places. There are equivalents in, for example, France, where we have le Conseil d'État as the supreme court for administrative justice, and the right of the defendant is called "le droit de la défense."

*Le Conseil d'État:*

> The Conseil d'État, translated as the Council of State, is a key institution in the French government responsible for providing legal advice to the executive branch and acting as the supreme administrative court of France. It is composed of senior members of the judiciary and is tasked with overseeing the legality and consistency of administrative decisions.
>
> The Conseil d'État has several main functions:
>
> 1. **Administrative Law**: It acts as the highest administrative court in France, hearing appeals against administrative decisions made by lower administrative courts and administrative authorities.
>
> 2. **Legal Advice**: The Conseil d'État provides legal advice to the government on matters of administrative law, constitutional law, and public policy. It reviews draft legislation and regulations to ensure their legality and conformity with French law and the Constitution.
>
> 3. **Constitutional Review**: It also has the power to review the constitutionality of laws and regulations before they are promulgated. This role is complementary to that of the Constitutional Council, which reviews laws after their promulgation.
>
> 4. **Supervision of Administrative Functioning**: The Conseil d'État supervises the functioning of administrative authorities and ensures that they operate within the bounds of the law and respect individuals' rights.
>
> 5. **Advisory Opinions**: It provides advisory opinions to the government, parliament, and other administrative bodies on legal matters and public policy issues.
>
> Overall, the Conseil d'État plays a crucial role in the French legal and administrative system, ensuring the rule of law, protecting individual rights, and providing legal guidance to the government.

*Le droit de la défense:*

> "Le droit de la défense" translates to "the right to defense" in English. In the context of law, it refers to the fundamental principle that individuals have the right to defend themselves and present their case when their rights, interests, or freedoms are at stake in legal or administrative proceedings.
>
> The right to defense encompasses various procedural rights and guarantees aimed at ensuring a fair and impartial process. These may include:
>
> 1. **Right to Be Heard**: Individuals have the right to be heard and to present their arguments, evidence, and defenses before a competent authority.
>
> 2. **Right to Legal Representation**: Individuals have the right to be represented by legal counsel or an attorney of their choosing, who can provide legal advice, advocate on their behalf, and protect their rights.
>
> 3. **Right to Access Information**: Individuals have the right to access relevant information, evidence, and documentation related to their case to prepare an effective defense.
>
> 4. **Right to Challenge Adverse Decisions**: Individuals have the right to challenge adverse decisions made against them through legal avenues such as appeals or judicial review.
>
> 5. **Right to Due Process**: The right to defense is closely linked to the broader principle of due process, which ensures that legal proceedings are conducted fairly, transparently, and in accordance with established rules and procedures.
>
> Overall, "le droit de la défense" is a fundamental principle of justice and the rule of law, essential for protecting individuals' rights and ensuring the integrity of legal and administrative proceedings.
>
> "le droit de la défense" is recognized as a constitutional right. While it is not explicitly enumerated in the French Constitution, it is derived from various constitutional provisions and is upheld by the French legal system as an essential component of the rule of law and fair administration of justice.

Notice that the statutory law doesn’t mention anything about the right to remain silent. Only the definitions of what constitutes kidnapping, assault, robbery, etc. are defined by the law. The responsibility of the judge would just be to check how the situation is to be defined in terms of the law: “Shall we say that this is a robbery...?” In this case, the 5^th^ Amendment was interpreted; there was an active involvement of the judge. The judge is not only the servant of the law but also the root of the law.

## Modern common law

The tradition is that law in liberal states has existed only for several subjects with the objective of protecting public order and public defenses. During the era of revolutions and with the development of common law, the common idea was to protect the liberty of the state and its population. That's why many legal aspects are not ruled by public bodies but by people directly. On one hand, the state can be crucial, and there is always supposed to be a risk of dictatorship; on the other hand, the state is the one to protect its population from dictatorship. In order to do so, the legislative bodies have been regulated, partly by the constitutions and partly by the bodies themselves. The public body must be limited and directly ruled by people; that's why we are also ruled by local parties.

### Equality

Take contract law as an example. Contract law is a large part of the common law system and is usually the issue of local courts.

> In the United States, contract law is primarily governed by state law rather than federal law. Each state has its own set of laws and principles that govern contracts, although many of these laws share similarities due to common legal heritage and influences.
>
> While there are some federal laws that impact certain types of contracts or regulate specific industries, such as federal regulations governing contracts with the government or federal securities laws, the vast majority of contract disputes are resolved based on state contract law.

A contract is an agreement between parties, creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law; it's the law of people. In liberal states during the early years, the idea was to say that when people negotiate, they are free to do what they want, and the only limitation is respect for public order. There are some trades that are illegal, even under the principle of free trade. For example, drugs are out of trade, as are slaveries. For centuries, the trading of slaves was legal, but it became illegal in the 19^th^ century. There was a liberal conception with the idea that, out of the protection of the public order, people are free to do whatever they want, and the statutory law is to define what is in the area of protection of the public order.

There were evolutions in this liberal conception. One is the protection of consumers' rights. Contracts need to be recognized by both parties, meaning that in the liberal conception, if we want a fair contract, we have to make sure the two parties are in the same situation and have the same knowledge. (Is there an inequality between the two parties? Are they in the same status?) Since the consumer, compared to the producer, is the uninformed part of the contract, certain rights need to be guaranteed to sign such a contract. This has its origin in trying to create equality between the supplier and the consumer.

For example, in many agricultural products, such as potatoes, farmers can use a lot of chemicals that violate the health of the consumer. When buying potatoes, consumers can only see the potatoes directly for their physical aspects, but they don't know what happened before and cannot know in what ways the potatoes are cultivated, like if chemical elements such as pesticides are used for the growing. So states have a moral and a political mandate to protect their population from threats to health.

Here comes the notion of the rights of consumers. In traditional trade systems, each person knows the same information, but in modern agriculture, there’s no equal contract between the seller and the consumer; there is one who knows and one who doesn’t. Because of scientific development, there is a heavy risk for consumers to sign a contract that is not fair. With technology, one can fake data or information.

That’s why, in the modern common law system, there's been the development of statutory laws. During the development of welfare states, the public body has to create laws to obligate sellers and protect consumers. We need statutory law to regulate different specific situations, such as conditions of preservation, information, etc., and protect those who don't have the specific knowledge, especially when new technologies are involved. Statutory laws are a tool to educate, create incentives, or deter; mandate safer product design and use of property; and alter the informational, physical, or economic environment, although this also constrains the autonomy, privacy, liberty, and proprietary interests of individuals and businesses. The idea is that the public authorities have to involve themselves in the freedom of trade and protect the rights of consumers.
