## The tradition of common law

Much of criminal law, as well as the legal process in general, is based on precedent. This means that judicial decisions made in similar cases in the past serve as a guide for current cases. These precedents are preserved over time through court records and are documented in collections of case law, such as yearbooks and reports.

> The "yearbooks" referred to in the context are collections of legal cases and decisions that were historically documented and compiled over the years. These yearbooks typically contain summaries or reports of significant legal rulings and judicial decisions made in various courts during specific time periods. They serve as valuable resources for legal practitioners, scholars, and historians, providing insights into the development of legal principles, precedents, and the evolution of the law over time. Each yearbook is typically organized chronologically, allowing users to trace the progression of legal thought and jurisprudence within a given jurisdiction.

> Yearbooks of legal cases and decisions are typically published by legal publishers, academic institutions, or professional organizations specializing in law. These publishers compile and curate relevant cases from various court proceedings and legal sources, and then organize them into volumes or editions for publication. Examples of publishers known for producing legal yearbooks include Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, Thomson Reuters, and LexisNexis. Additionally, some governmental bodies or judicial institutions may also publish official reports or compilations of legal cases within their jurisdictions.

The precedents to be applied in the decision of each new case are determined by the presiding judge, which means that the judges play an enormous role.

In addition to case law, common law systems also include codified written laws. In countries that follow the common law system, the parliament passes laws that are written down, known as statues. These laws cover various aspects of legal matters, such as defining criminal acts.

Statute law defines specific rights and defenses, such as safeguarding individual freedoms. In a representative system, elected officials vote on behalf of the people to ensure the protection of individual freedoms. The legal framework further strengthens human rights by outlining the definition of various offenses.
