## Different branches of law (continue)

### The notion of "fatwa" (continue)

A fatwa is a clarification of Islamic law by scholars, muftis, or certain judges. The objective of a fatwa is to provide people with an interpretation of traditional rules to address problems related to daily life, particularly private life. Many fatwas pertain specifically to daily activities. For example, there was a fatwa I mentioned earlier about space exploration and the position of astronauts. Numerous fatwas also address various aspects of sexual life, clarifying what is allowed and what is not, in accordance with God's law.

Fatwas can also cover aspects of very daily life, such as relationships between spouses, interactions with children, and family law. They may offer guidance on appropriate behavior with your boss, employees, or clients. Additionally, fatwas can provide instructions on daily religious practices, such as the rights and behaviors during religious ceremonies or prayers. They define what constitutes good or bad behavior during prayer and other daily religious rituals.

> A fatwa is a formal legal opinion or ruling issued by an Islamic scholar, known as a mufti, on matters of Islamic law (Sharia). It is a response to a specific question or issue brought by an individual or a court, addressing a wide range of topics including religious practices, social issues, business dealings, and personal conduct.
>
> Here are key points about a fatwa:
>
> 1. **Authority**: While a fatwa is respected and considered authoritative within the Muslim community, it is not universally binding. Different scholars may issue different fatwas on the same issue, leading to a variety of interpretations and practices within Islam.
>
> 2. **Sources**: Fatwas are based on interpretations of the Quran, Hadith (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad), consensus of scholars (ijma), and analogical reasoning (qiyas). The specific sources and methods can vary among different Islamic traditions and schools of thought.
>
> 3. **Contextual and Advisory**: A fatwa is generally context-specific and addresses the questioner's particular circumstances. It is advisory rather than judicial, meaning it does not have the force of law unless endorsed by a governing authority in countries where Sharia is part of the legal system.
>
> 4. **Variety of Issues**: Fatwas can address almost any issue a Muslim might face, from the minutiae of daily rituals to complex legal matters. Common topics include dietary laws, religious observances, family matters, and ethical dilemmas.
>
> 5. **Public vs. Private**: Some fatwas are issued in response to private queries, while others are made public to address widespread issues or concerns within the community.
>
> 6. **Not Universal**: Different Islamic sects (e.g., Sunni, Shia) and schools of jurisprudence (e.g., Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) may have different processes and guidelines for issuing fatwas, and a fatwa issued by one authority may not be recognized by others.

A fatwa can be considered a norm because it comes from a recognized authority. The issue lies in determining whether the authority who issued the fatwa is deemed sufficiently important. For instance, in the case of Salman Rushdie that we discussed earlier, the fatwa came from Ayatollah Khomeini. This meant that the fatwa was seen as an order or a real norm by those who follow Ayatollah Khomeini and adhere to the Shiite branch of Islam. In Islam, there are two main branches, and for the followers of the Shiite branch, Ayatollah Khomeini was regarded as a very high-level authority. Thus, his interpretation was considered an order or a norm.

> The Sunni and Shiite branches of Islam primarily differ in their beliefs about the rightful successor to Prophet Muhammad, with Sunnis supporting Abu Bakr, chosen through consensus, and Shiites advocating for Ali, the Prophetâ€™s cousin and son-in-law, as divinely appointed. This split, originating in the 7th century, led to distinct religious authorities, with Sunnis following elected caliphs and diverse jurisprudential schools, while Shiites emphasize a line of Imams starting with Ali. Sunnis constitute about 85-90% of Muslims globally, dominating regions like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, whereas Shiites, about 10-15%, are concentrated in Iran and parts of Iraq and Lebanon. Despite both sects sharing core Islamic tenets, they differ in practices such as prayer rituals and the observance of religious events like Ashura, which is particularly significant for Shiites. These differences have influenced the religious, cultural, and political dynamics within the Muslim world.
>
> The conservatism of Shiite and Sunni branches of Islam is not uniformly inherent to either sect but varies significantly based on regional, cultural, and political contexts. For instance, Shiite Islam in Iran is often perceived as highly conservative due to theocratic governance, while in Lebanon, the practices may be more diverse. Similarly, Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation influenced by Wahhabism, contrasting with more moderate practices in Sunni-majority countries like Turkey or Indonesia. Therefore, the degree of conservatism in both branches is influenced by local traditions, political regimes, and cultural factors rather than being a fixed characteristic of Shiism or Sunnism.

However, for other Muslims who belong to different branches or do not follow Shiism, it was merely an interpretation that they did not necessarily follow. When the fatwa was issued, not all Muslims attempted to harm Rushdie. Some did because they were linked to Khomeini and agreed with his interpretation. However, the majority of Muslims did not attempt to prosecute or execute Rushdie because they did not view Khomeini's order as a binding norm. This distinction also depends on whether we are discussing moderate, liberal, or more conservative Muslims.

For example, Khomeini's order was accepted by some people in Afghanistan, even if they were not Shiite, because they favored a very strict and conservative interpretation of Islam and believed Khomeini was right. Conversely, in many countries with a more liberal or moderate approach to Islam, Khomeini's order was not followed. Rushdie, during his conferences, met some Muslims who did not accept Khomeini's decision, viewing it as too strict and conservative. These Muslims were shocked by the idea of the "Satanic Verses" and the expression it represented, but while they disagreed with Rushdie's position, they did not believe he should be killed.

On the other hand, some people felt that being offended justified retaliating against the writer. The main difference lies in the authority of the scholar who issued the interpretation of Sharia and whether what is written in this expression of Sharia is considered a good response. Many Muslims were shocked but did not believe Rushdie should be executed. They thought that if Rushdie were to be punished, it would be by God in the afterlife, not by them. They felt it was not their duty to speak for God. In contrast, some believe they must act as the enforcers of God's law on earth, prosecuting and executing those who do not respect it.

Fatwa is an interpretation of Sharia that some people follow, but not everyone does. And this is why, for example, in the practice of ritual ceremonies, you can observe differences from one country to another. Different countries have scholars who issue fatwas with slightly varying interpretations, leading to these differences. This variation arises from interpreting unclear matters and applying these interpretations to specific cases. For instance, regarding the appropriate reaction when a writer publishes a book deemed offensive to God, one interpretation might be to strongly oppose the book, refuse to read it, and ban its sale, without advocating for the writer's punishment. Consequently, in many Muslim countries, such books are prohibited by the authorities.

There have also been instances where fatwas have been issued regarding movies. For example, the recent Barbie movie was prohibited from being shown in many Muslim countries. In some countries, this ban was enforced by law, as in Algeria. In other countries, the prohibition came from religious authorities issuing fatwas, stating that the movie was offensive to God, disrespectful towards women, and contrary to religious principles concerning the relationship between men and women. Consequently, the film was banned in those territories. However, this was not the case in all Muslim countries; in some, people were free to watch the film. This demonstrates the range of responses: some authorities may simply disapprove of a book or movie, others may ban it from being sold or shown, and still others may seek to prosecute the author, arrest them, jail them, or even call for their execution.

But this is one interpretation at a specific moment for one book or one movie, and it is not necessarily applied uniformly across all countries. The influence of a fatwa depends on the recognition and authority of the issuing scholars, which can vary. Additionally, Muslim countries have different approaches to applying religious rules in civil society. For example, Morocco is relatively liberal, and the movie Barbie was not prohibited; people could watch it in cinemas. This was not the case in Algeria, where the film was banned, either by law or executive order, through official government notification. In other countries, fatwas issued by scholars led to the ban, which might or might not be followed. As we discussed, there are varying degrees of prohibition: in some countries, the movie is outright banned, while in others, it is not prohibited but socially discouraged, leaving individuals free to choose whether to watch it or not.

A fatwa can be considered a kind of norm, but it is not a universal norm that must be applied by everyone. Its influence depends largely on the reputation of the author of the fatwa. There are many kinds of fatwas, and while high-profile cases like Salman Rushdie's receive a lot of media attention, there are numerous fatwas issued on a wide range of subjects in the regular legal life of Muslim countries. Some fatwas have very local applications, specific to a particular country or even a specific town. Conversely, some fatwas are widely applied across many countries. Additionally, there are fatwas that are very old; fatwas have been issued since the time of the Prophet's death centuries ago. Some fatwas from the 19th or 20th century are still referenced by judges or authorities to determine what is permissible or not.

### The notion of Hisbah

Hisbah means the rule of moral rectitude. The idea behind it is to provide the population with guidelines to determine what is permissible and not permissible in public areas. This is the purpose of Hisbah.

> Hisbah is an Islamic concept that refers to the duty of enjoining good and forbidding wrong. Rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, it encompasses the promotion of ethical conduct and the prevention of immoral or harmful behavior within an Islamic society. The term "Hisbah" comes from the Arabic root "hasaba," which means to reckon or to account, implying the act of holding individuals and society accountable to Islamic principles.
>
> Key Aspects of Hisbah
>
> 1. **Theological Basis:**
>    - Hisbah is based on various Quranic verses and Hadiths that emphasize the importance of promoting virtue and preventing vice. For example, the Quran states, "Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong" (Quran 3:104).
>
> 2. **Role and Functions:**
>    - Traditionally, the role of Hisbah was carried out by a designated official known as the Muhtasib, who was responsible for market regulation, public morals, and ensuring adherence to Islamic law in public life.
>    - The Muhtasib would oversee activities such as ensuring honest trade practices, maintaining public order, preventing cheating in commerce, and upholding moral conduct.
>
> 3. **Modern Implementation:**
>    - In contemporary times, Hisbah functions are often carried out by government or quasi-governmental bodies in some Muslim-majority countries. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice performs similar roles.
>    - The scope and methods of Hisbah enforcement can vary widely, ranging from advisory and educational activities to more coercive measures.
>
> 4. **Controversies and Criticism:**
>    - Hisbah practices, especially when enforced by state authorities, have been subject to criticism and controversy. Issues include the potential for human rights abuses, infringement on personal freedoms, and the imposition of strict interpretations of morality.
>    - Critics argue that the application of Hisbah can sometimes lead to the persecution of individuals for behaviors deemed unacceptable by conservative interpretations of Islamic law.
>
> Conclusion
>
> Hisbah represents a significant aspect of Islamic governance and social ethics, emphasizing the collective responsibility to uphold moral standards and prevent wrongdoing within the community. However, its implementation and impact can vary greatly depending on the socio-political context and the interpretations of Islamic law in different regions.

In Iran, there is a branch of the police known as the "morality police." This specific branch of the police system operates within cities to observe and ensure that people adhere to the moral duties prescribed by Islamic law in Iran. For instance, when I was lecturing at a university in Iran, the use of elevators was prohibited at one point. This restriction was imposed because the morality police were inspecting the university buildings and determined that men and women could be alone in the elevator, potentially engaging in prohibited behaviors such as kissing, touching, or hugging. To prevent such actions, which are strictly forbidden in public areas, the elevators were closed to everyone. The university had six levels, making it quite inconvenient, but this serves as an example of the influence and actions of the morality police.

> Iran's morality police, officially known as the "Guidance Patrol" (Gasht-e Ershad), is a specialized unit tasked with enforcing Islamic dress codes and social behavior in public spaces. The primary focus of the morality police is to ensure adherence to the Islamic dress code, particularly the requirement for women to wear the hijab (a headscarf covering the hair) and modest clothing that covers the arms and legs. They also monitor other aspects of public behavior, including interactions between men and women, the observance of religious practices, and general moral conduct according to the state's interpretation of Islamic law.
>
> The morality police operate by patrolling public areas, issuing warnings, fines, or detaining individuals who are deemed to be violating the dress code or other moral guidelines. Their actions have been a subject of controversy and criticism, both domestically and internationally, for their perceived infringement on personal freedoms and human rights. Protests and opposition to their activities have been significant, especially from women's rights activists and younger generations who advocate for more personal freedom and less stringent enforcement of dress codes and social behaviors.

Hisbah enforces the obligation of public decency in public areas, not as a suggestion but as a norm that everyone must follow. The administration has a duty to ensure respect for this norm through various controls. For example, in Iran, the requirement for women to wear a veil serves as an indicator of the current stance of public authorities. During periods of strict enforcement, the morality police closely monitor women, ensuring their veils are properly positioned to cover their hair. A woman with a veil placed too high, revealing the base of her hair, would be instructed to adjust it. Conversely, in more liberal periods, the state is less vigilant, allowing women to wear their veils higher on their heads, thus showing some hair. In the view of those who mandate the veil, visible hair is seen as a form of sexual aggression and nudity. The enforcement of this rule reflects the administration's position: sometimes very strict, with active morality police, and sometimes more lenient, allowing women to wear their veils less strictly.

In terms of public behavior, there has been the question of whether a woman can go outside alone. In some Muslim countries, like Saudi Arabia until recently, it was forbidden for a woman to go out alone. She had to be accompanied by a male relativeâ€”father, husband, uncle, cousin, brother, or son. Additionally, groups of women were not allowed to go out without a male present. Until about two or three years ago, women in Saudi Arabia were also forbidden from driving. Driving was considered an offense to the traditional norms governing relationships between men and women. This policy was modified recently, and now women are allowed to drive. However, this is a very recent development, and for decades, driving was strictly prohibited for moral reasons, as it was seen as contrary to the accepted norms of male-female relationships and women's expected behavior. So, from a moral perspective, these restrictions were in place to uphold what was considered appropriate conduct.

> In recent years, Saudi Arabia has implemented a series of social and legal reforms that have significantly increased women's rights and freedoms. These reforms are part of the Vision 2030 initiative, which aims to modernize the country and diversify its economy.
>
> Some key changes regarding women's rights include:
>
> 1. **Driving**: In 2018, Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on women driving, allowing them to obtain driver's licenses and drive cars.
>
> 2. **Travel**: In 2019, Saudi Arabia changed its guardianship laws, allowing women over the age of 21 to travel abroad without the need for a male guardian's permission.
>
> 3. **Employment**: Women are now allowed to work in a wider range of industries and professions, including roles that were previously restricted to men.
>
> 4. **Public Spaces**: Women can now attend sporting events, concerts, and other public gatherings, which were previously segregated or restricted.
>
> 5. **Business and Legal Affairs**: Women can now register a business, attend court sessions, and represent themselves in legal matters without a male guardian.
>
> These reforms have greatly increased the visibility and participation of women in public life in Saudi Arabia. However, cultural norms and practices may still influence the extent to which women feel comfortable or are encouraged to go out alone in certain areas.

Hisbah also encompasses various aspects related to food, such as the prohibition of eating pork and drinking alcohol. These prohibitions stem from the concept of moral behavior as dictated by God, according to their beliefs, and there is a moral obligation to adhere to these rules. In Iran, the morality police are very powerful, and failing to respect these rules can lead to prosecution. Individuals can be sentenced to jail for violating principles of morality across a range of issues. Additionally, in some countries, possessing certain books can be punishable. For instance, reading "The Satanic Verses" can result in prosecution for not respecting moral norms. In some Muslim countries, possessing a Bibleâ€”the holy book of another religionâ€”is considered an offense to morality, applicable to Muslims and sometimes non-Muslims as well. Afghanistan is an example where such strict interpretations of morality are enforced. This strict adherence is based on their conception of moral obligations.

Of course, this does not apply to all Muslim countries. It is important to remember that while Islamic law has some general principles, its application and strictness vary widely. For example, regarding the observance of Ramadan, some countries enforce very strict adherence, meaning no one can drink or eat during the day without risking punishment. In other countries, there is a general social acceptance of Ramadan, where the majority of the population observes it out of religious belief and tradition. However, non-observance is not criminalized and does not lead to prosecution. It is more of a social practice where those not observing Ramadan might face moral condemnation but no legal consequences. In some countries, non-observance can result in legal penalties. For instance, in Afghanistan, violations can be punished by whipping or lapidation. However, this is not the case in the majority of Muslim countries. Many countries have social expectations but no legal obligations. For example, in Morocco, due to significant tourism, tourists are not required to observe Ramadan. While most of the population respects Ramadan, some may not strictly follow it, such as drinking during the day due to the heat. This might lead to social criticism, as the majority might be shocked by non-observance, but it does not result in legal prosecution. In contrast, in some countries, non-observance can lead to severe legal penalties.

> ==Lapidation==, commonly known as stoning, is a form of capital punishment where a group of people throws stones at a person until they die. This method of execution is used as a punishment for various offenses in some legal systems, particularly in certain interpretations of Islamic law (Sharia), although it is rare and highly controversial.
>
> Lapidation has historically been used to punish acts such as adultery, blasphemy, and apostasy, among others. The practice is intended to serve as a severe deterrent to others and is characterized by its public and communal nature, often involving members of the community in the execution process.
>
> Stoning is widely condemned by international human rights organizations and many countries for its brutal and inhumane nature. Efforts continue to abolish this form of punishment in places where it is still legally sanctioned.

### The notion of diya
