## Different branches of law in China (continue)

### Administrative law

> **Influence of the Marxist System**
>
> Administrative law in China is significantly influenced by the Marxist system, which emphasizes that administrative bodies act on behalf of the people. Traditionally, in communist countries, including China, there was a reluctance to allow citizens to challenge executive orders through independent judicial processes. Instead, disputes were addressed within the hierarchical structure of the administration, prioritizing equity over strict legality. This approach reflected the principle that administrative actions were inherently aligned with the interests of the proletariat and the state.

> **Evolution of Administrative Law**
>
> However, significant reforms began to take shape starting in 1989. Prior to these changes, citizens seeking to contest administrative decisions had limited avenues. Appeals against executive orders were typically made directly to higher administrative offices rather than through independent judicial review. This system lacked judicial independence, making it difficult for citizens to hold administrative bodies accountable.
>
> In response to growing demands for greater transparency and accountability, China introduced several legislative changes:
>
> - **June 1, 1989 Law**: This foundational law began the process of allowing citizens to seek redress against administrative actions.
>
> - **2003 and 2013 Amendments**: These further developments led to the establishment of specialized administrative chambers within local courts, enhancing the ability of citizens to challenge administrative decisions legally.
>
> - **Chinese Court of Human Rights (2014)**: This institution was created to oversee cases related to human rights, including those involving administrative law, providing a more structured mechanism for addressing grievances.
>
> **Comparison with Continental Law**
>
> In traditional continental law systems, administrative law is typically bifurcated into separate judicial bodies that examine whether executive and administrative bodies adhere to the law. These systems ensure that administrative actions are legally compliant and provide citizens with the means to challenge unlawful decisions through independent courts.
>
> Conversely, in the communist framework, administrative bodies were historically viewed as extensions of the state’s will to serve the people, thereby limiting the scope for legal challenges. Disputes were often handled internally within the administrative hierarchy rather than through an independent judiciary, focusing more on equitable solutions rather than legal correctness.
>
> **Current Mechanism for Challenging Administrative Decisions**
>
> Since the reforms initiated in 1989, China has progressively integrated more robust mechanisms for citizens to challenge administrative decisions:
>
> 1. **Administrative Chambers in Local Courts**: Each local court now includes an administrative chamber responsible for reviewing the legality of executive orders and administrative actions. These chambers assess whether administrative decisions comply with the law and the constitution.
>
> 2. **Judicial Review Process**: When a citizen believes that an administrative order is unlawful, they can file a complaint with the administrative chamber of their local court. The chamber evaluates the case to determine if the executive action violates any legal standards or constitutional provisions.
>
> 3. **Role of the Chinese Court of Human Rights**: Established in 2014, this court handles cases related to human rights and provides an additional layer of oversight, ensuring that administrative actions do not infringe upon individual rights.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> The evolution of administrative law in China reflects a gradual shift towards greater judicial oversight and accountability within the framework of a Marxist state. While the foundational principles remain influenced by Marxist ideology, emphasizing the role of administrative bodies in serving the people, the introduction of administrative chambers and the Chinese Court of Human Rights signifies an ongoing effort to balance these principles with the need for legal accountability and the protection of citizens’ rights.

Not all administrative acts can be challenged in court. There are two main **exceptions** to this rule:

1. **State Decisions on Military Defense and Diplomacy**: Any state decisions related to national defense or diplomacy cannot be brought before a judge. These matters are considered expressions of national sovereignty, and citizens are not permitted to challenge or question them in court. This exception serves as a form of protection for **public order** and national security.

2. **Executive Orders with a General Purpose**: Executive orders issued for the **general public interest**—such as those aimed at protecting the broader welfare of society—are also exempt from judicial review. These decisions, which are considered essential for safeguarding the public good, cannot be contested in court.

However, most other administrative decisions, particularly individual decisions, can be brought before a judge. This includes situations where an administrative body makes a decision affecting an individual, such as granting or refusing an authorization. In such cases, it is possible for the affected person to challenge the decision in court. For example, if a public servant disagrees with a decision made by their administrative hierarchy regarding their career—such as a promotion or disciplinary action—they have the right to go before a judge and request a review and possible reformation of the decision. This provides a mechanism for individuals to seek judicial oversight and remedy in cases of administrative decisions that directly impact their personal or professional lives.

This type of judicial challenge was absolutely not possible during the early years of the Communist Party's rule. In the communist organizational structure, the Communist Party was the leading force in the country, and the roles of the state and the Party were closely intertwined. Although they were not exactly the same, they were so similar that contesting a state decision was effectively seen as contesting a decision of the Party. Since the Party and the state were so closely linked, challenging administrative decisions was viewed as questioning the authority of the Communist Party itself. As a result, such actions were not permitted, and citizens had no legal recourse to challenge state or Party decisions.

Another area where citizens can challenge decisions is in matters related to property law. This became particularly significant during the Beijing Olympic Games, when a large number of properties were expropriated by the state for the construction of stadiums, housing for athletes, media buildings, hotels, and other facilities. Prior to this, under the Marxist system, there was no robust protection for private property in China. As in many communist countries, property was seen as a social asset, meaning the state had the right to seize private property for the public benefit. During the preparation for the Olympics, the Chinese government carried out numerous expropriations (or evictions) to make way for the necessary infrastructure. For the first time, however, many citizens began to challenge these actions, arguing that it was unfair to be evicted without proper compensation. Before this period, expropriation was a routine state action, as the state's power over property was absolute. But with China's gradual shift toward a more liberal legal system, property rights started to gain recognition, and citizens could finally challenge expropriation decisions in court. This marked a major evolution in the legal protection of private property in China.

Another significant evolution in China has been linked to the protection of individual liberties, particularly during the 1990s. This development was influenced by the protection of individual rights in Western and liberal countries. As we discussed previously, under the Marxist system, individual liberties were not considered real or essential. In Marx's analysis during the 19th century, the protection of individual freedoms and public liberties in liberal states was viewed as a trap for the working class. Marxist thought suggested that, while liberal states claimed to protect individual rights, they did so in a way that ultimately maintained the exploitation of workers. The core problem for workers, in Marx's view, was not about having individual liberties, but rather their dire economic conditions. He argued that the protection of such liberties served the interests of the bourgeoisie rather than addressing the workers' true needs.

In the Marxist perspective, individual liberties were seen as tools that could be used against the revolution, which was necessary to overthrow the capitalist system. The idea was that, once a communist society was established, the need for public freedoms would disappear because the society would be perfect—everyone would receive what they needed, and there would be no inequality or oppression. In this ideal society, the issues of freedom and liberties would naturally resolve themselves, making the formal protection of these rights unnecessary. As a result, during the early stages of communist rule, the protection of liberties was downplayed or restricted to protect the revolution. The primary focus was on safeguarding the communist movement, with the belief that achieving a communist society would ultimately solve the problems of freedom and justice.

This is why, in all communist countries, without exception, there was a transitional period between the old bourgeois state and the envisioned new communist society. This period, exemplified by the existence of the USSR (which lasted 72 or 73 years), was seen as a period of transition. During this time, the goal was to move from the old liberal order to the new communist society. In this phase, the revolution needed to be strict and uncompromising, especially in rejecting the application of public and individual liberties, as these freedoms were seen as tools that could be exploited by the enemies of the revolution to undermine its success. This same approach was seen in the USSR, East Germany, Poland, and still exists today in North Korea. It was also prevalent in countries like Vietnam, Albania, and other Eastern European nations. In China, for decades, there was no formal protection of individual liberties because such rights were perceived to protect the interests of the old bourgeois order and to aid those who opposed the revolution. The prevailing belief was that individual liberties would be used to resist the communist transformation, thus threatening the establishment of the new communist society.

This is why it was a significant step when, during the 1980s, the Chinese legal system—particularly the administrative law system—introduced the possibility for individuals to challenge executive orders that limited their individual rights or freedoms. For the first time, it became possible for citizens to bring such cases before a judge, marking a major shift from the previous era when individual liberties were not protected, and state authority was largely unquestionable. This change occurred gradually throughout the 1980s, with the introduction of several key legal texts and reforms.

### The criminal process of law

Here, we see a similar perspective regarding the Marxist conception of law. Before the 1980s, China did not have a fully developed criminal process of law. While there was a criminal code that defined various crimes, the enforcement of criminal law was primarily controlled by the administration and the Communist Party. In practice, this meant that criminal law was not independently enforced or adjudicated by a separate judiciary but was instead overseen and regulated by the Party, which held ultimate authority over legal matters.

For example, regarding the application of the death penalty, the Chinese criminal code listed various crimes or offenses that could, in some cases, be punished by death. According to the criminal code, the decision to apply the death penalty was supposed to be made by the Supreme Court. As we discussed last week, in the structure of the judicial system, the Supreme Court is at the top. However, in practice, the real application was different. In actual cases, the decision to apply the death penalty was often made by the provincial administration. At the time, provincial administrations were composed entirely of Communist Party representatives. Thus, while the legal text suggested that the death penalty decision rested with the justice system as it does in many other countries, in practice, it was controlled by political bodies. The Supreme Court, which was theoretically responsible for such decisions, was effectively excluded from the process.

This was a common practice in countries ruled by the Marxist and Communist systems. In these systems, there was no real separation of powers. The prevailing idea was that the revolution aimed to achieve the victory of the people, with the unity of the people being essential to this cause. The Communist Party was seen as the leading and pioneering force behind the revolution. As a result, legal texts in these countries often resembled those in other legal systems, outlining principles of justice and law. However, in practice, the reality was different. The Communist Party, as the primary actor in government, was responsible for making decisions across many areas, including those related to the death penalty. It was not a matter of justice or law, but rather a political decision made by political organs, driven by the broader goals of the Communist Party.

Things began to change in 1980, when it was decided that criminal law would be applied through the criminal justice system rather than being controlled by political bodies. As we discussed last week, each court includes a criminal law chamber, and it is this chamber that handles cases involving criminal law. Over the years, several reforms have been introduced. For instance, in 1996, there was a significant reform of the Criminal Code, which established the principle of the presumption of innocence for individuals being prosecuted.

The principle of innocence—also known as the presumption of innocence—is a core tenet in all countries that follow a liberal conception of justice. The idea is that it is the prosecutor's responsibility to prove that someone is guilty, not the accused’s duty to prove their innocence. In such legal systems, there is a clear distinction between the roles of the judge and the prosecutor. The judge, who presides over the court, listens to the arguments presented by the barristers and ultimately delivers a ruling. On the other hand, the prosecutor—who is also a magistrate and a trained lawyer—has a distinct role. The prosecutor is tasked with representing and protecting the public interest. This means that their job is to prosecute individuals who are believed to have acted against society, such as murderers, thieves, and other criminals. In the liberal justice system, it is the prosecutor's duty to work alongside law enforcement, such as detectives and the police, to gather evidence and build a case that proves the guilt of the accused.

The general liberal principle in justice systems is that when you are being prosecuted, you are presumed not guilty. Throughout the trial, you are considered innocent until proven guilty, and it is the prosecutor's responsibility to establish your guilt. This is known as the principle of innocence, which means that unless the prosecutor can prove that you are guilty, you remain innocent. This principle is a fundamental aspect of liberal justice systems around the world, and it applies in both common law and continental law systems.

The principle of innocence was viewed as dangerous in the Marxist system, as it was perceived to undermine the victory of the revolution. A notorious example of this in the USSR is the Stalinist trials of 1937. Stalin, who was not only a dictator but arguably had psychopathic tendencies, orchestrated a series of trials against so-called traitors. Many of those prosecuted were veteran members of the Communist Party, individuals who had been close comrades of Lenin during the tsarist period and who had played pivotal roles in the revolution. These individuals were accused of plotting against Stalin, the Communist Party, and the interests of the people. Today, these trials are remembered as examples of grossly unfair justice, where the accused were presumed guilty from the outset. The trials were essentially show trials, where the outcome was predetermined. Even defense barristers, who were supposed to represent the accused, often refused to defend their clients. In some cases, when it was their turn to speak, they would say, "I have nothing to say because the evidence against my client is overwhelming," reflecting the futility of any genuine defense. This approach was a reflection of the Marxist conception of justice during the post-revolutionary period—the time between the fall of the bourgeois state and the establishment of a communist society. During this transitional period, there was no room for freedom or liberty, because, as mentioned earlier, such freedoms were seen as tools that could be used by the enemies of the revolution to undermine its progress.

You can understand the issue with the principle of innocence in a Marxist system. If someone in the opposition criticizes the leader, the party, or the government, and you say, "I will give him a fair trial and, unless the prosecutor proves his guilt, he is not guilty and must be released," this would be seen, in the Marxist conception, as a sign of weakness. Particularly in Stalin's view, offering fair trials to those opposing the revolution or the Party would reflect the weakness of the revolution and the vulnerability of the workers in the face of enemies of the revolution. In the trials under Stalin, what we now recognize as a fair trial was entirely absent. These trials are what we would now call unfair justice—with no real protection of the accused's rights. Today, when someone compares a trial to the Stalinist trials, it implies a process that is totally unfair, where the rights of the accused are disregarded.

Before 1980, China operated similarly to the USSR and other communist countries during the intermediary period between the Bolshevik state and the full realization of the revolution, where the presumption of innocence was not recognized, and trials were heavily controlled by political bodies. However, in 1996, a new Criminal Code was introduced. This code recognized the judge's ability to examine a case with the possibility of the defendant being innocent. What this means is that before 1996, the judge did not have to determine whether the accused was guilty or not guilty; they simply studied the file and made a decision based on that. The new legal framework required judges to consider the possibility that the accused could be innocent, although it still fell short of fully embracing the presumption of innocence as seen in liberal legal systems.This represents a subtle difference in degree.

In 2002, there was a significant decision made by the Supreme Court that stated it would be the Supreme Court that holds the authority to apply the death penalty. This decision was reinforced when the General Committee of the Communist Party also acknowledged that only the Supreme Court should have the authority to make such decisions, effectively removing this power from provincial political bodies. This represents a critical evolution in the Chinese legal system.

In 2004, the Constitution of China was amended to recognize the application of individual freedoms and individual liberties in various legal cases. This modification means that, since this decision, every trial or legal discussion must take into account the issue of individual rights. This represents a significant evolution, as in the Marxist conception, the focus was solely on the collective interest of society, with individual rights being virtually nonexistent. Individuals were entirely subordinate to the general social interest, with no balance or control mechanisms in place. The prevailing idea was that protecting the general interest took precedence, and individual interests could not be asserted when they conflicted with broader social goals. This shift marks a crucial development in the Chinese legal system, as it acknowledges that certain individual liberties must be respected during criminal trials.

For example, since 1996, a new principle was established stating that when you are prosecuted, you have the right to have a counsel or a barrister by your side. The law allows for up to two people to support you during the trial—either two barristers or one barrister and another individual of your choosing, such as a counselor or a witness, who will accompany you throughout the legal process. This was a significant development, as such protections were not available before. Under the previous communist system, the idea was that the Party knew everything, made all the decisions, and therefore, such legal protections were unnecessary. While these rights may have been written into legal texts, they were not actually practiced. I mentioned earlier that during Stalin's trials, some barristers would even state, "I believe my client is guilty; the evidence is overwhelming, and I refuse to present a defense." Such behavior would be unthinkable in liberal states. However, this kind of scenario was more common in communist regimes.
