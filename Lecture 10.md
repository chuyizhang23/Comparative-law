## Different branches of law in China (continue)

### Administrative law

> **Influence of the Marxist System**
>
> Administrative law in China is significantly influenced by the Marxist system, which emphasizes that administrative bodies act on behalf of the people. Traditionally, in communist countries, including China, there was a reluctance to allow citizens to challenge executive orders through independent judicial processes. Instead, disputes were addressed within the hierarchical structure of the administration, prioritizing equity over strict legality. This approach reflected the principle that administrative actions were inherently aligned with the interests of the proletariat and the state.

> **Evolution of Administrative Law**
>
> However, significant reforms began to take shape starting in 1989. Prior to these changes, citizens seeking to contest administrative decisions had limited avenues. Appeals against executive orders were typically made directly to higher administrative offices rather than through independent judicial review. This system lacked judicial independence, making it difficult for citizens to hold administrative bodies accountable.
>
> In response to growing demands for greater transparency and accountability, China introduced several legislative changes:
>
> - **June 1, 1989 Law**: This foundational law began the process of allowing citizens to seek redress against administrative actions.
>
> - **2003 and 2013 Amendments**: These further developments led to the establishment of specialized administrative chambers within local courts, enhancing the ability of citizens to challenge administrative decisions legally.
>
> - **Chinese Court of Human Rights (2014)**: This institution was created to oversee cases related to human rights, including those involving administrative law, providing a more structured mechanism for addressing grievances.
>
> **Comparison with Continental Law**
>
> In traditional continental law systems, administrative law is typically bifurcated into separate judicial bodies that examine whether executive and administrative bodies adhere to the law. These systems ensure that administrative actions are legally compliant and provide citizens with the means to challenge unlawful decisions through independent courts.
>
> Conversely, in the communist framework, administrative bodies were historically viewed as extensions of the state’s will to serve the people, thereby limiting the scope for legal challenges. Disputes were often handled internally within the administrative hierarchy rather than through an independent judiciary, focusing more on equitable solutions rather than legal correctness.
>
> **Current Mechanism for Challenging Administrative Decisions**
>
> Since the reforms initiated in 1989, China has progressively integrated more robust mechanisms for citizens to challenge administrative decisions:
>
> 1. **Administrative Chambers in Local Courts**: Each local court now includes an administrative chamber responsible for reviewing the legality of executive orders and administrative actions. These chambers assess whether administrative decisions comply with the law and the constitution.
>
> 2. **Judicial Review Process**: When a citizen believes that an administrative order is unlawful, they can file a complaint with the administrative chamber of their local court. The chamber evaluates the case to determine if the executive action violates any legal standards or constitutional provisions.
>
> 3. **Role of the Chinese Court of Human Rights**: Established in 2014, this court handles cases related to human rights and provides an additional layer of oversight, ensuring that administrative actions do not infringe upon individual rights.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> The evolution of administrative law in China reflects a gradual shift towards greater judicial oversight and accountability within the framework of a Marxist state. While the foundational principles remain influenced by Marxist ideology, emphasizing the role of administrative bodies in serving the people, the introduction of administrative chambers and the Chinese Court of Human Rights signifies an ongoing effort to balance these principles with the need for legal accountability and the protection of citizens’ rights.

Not all administrative acts can be challenged in court. There are two main **exceptions** to this rule:

1. **State Decisions on Military Defense and Diplomacy**: Any state decisions related to national defense or diplomacy cannot be brought before a judge. These matters are considered expressions of national sovereignty, and citizens are not permitted to challenge or question them in court. This exception serves as a form of protection for **public order** and national security.

2. **Executive Orders with a General Purpose**: Executive orders issued for the **general public interest**—such as those aimed at protecting the broader welfare of society—are also exempt from judicial review. These decisions, which are considered essential for safeguarding the public good, cannot be contested in court.

However, most other administrative decisions, particularly individual decisions, can be brought before a judge. This includes situations where an administrative body makes a decision affecting an individual, such as granting or refusing an authorization. In such cases, it is possible for the affected person to challenge the decision in court. For example, if a public servant disagrees with a decision made by their administrative hierarchy regarding their career—such as a promotion or disciplinary action—they have the right to go before a judge and request a review and possible reformation of the decision. This provides a mechanism for individuals to seek judicial oversight and remedy in cases of administrative decisions that directly impact their personal or professional lives.

This type of judicial challenge was absolutely not possible during the early years of the Communist Party's rule. In the communist organizational structure, the Communist Party was the leading force in the country, and the roles of the state and the Party were closely intertwined. Although they were not exactly the same, they were so similar that contesting a state decision was effectively seen as contesting a decision of the Party. Since the Party and the state were so closely linked, challenging administrative decisions was viewed as questioning the authority of the Communist Party itself. As a result, such actions were not permitted, and citizens had no legal recourse to challenge state or Party decisions.

Another area where citizens can challenge decisions is in matters related to property law. This became particularly significant during the Beijing Olympic Games, when a large number of properties were expropriated by the state for the construction of stadiums, housing for athletes, media buildings, hotels, and other facilities. Prior to this, under the Marxist system, there was no robust protection for private property in China. As in many communist countries, property was seen as a social asset, meaning the state had the right to seize private property for the public benefit. During the preparation for the Olympics, the Chinese government carried out numerous expropriations (or evictions) to make way for the necessary infrastructure. For the first time, however, many citizens began to challenge these actions, arguing that it was unfair to be evicted without proper compensation. Before this period, expropriation was a routine state action, as the state's power over property was absolute. But with China's gradual shift toward a more liberal legal system, property rights started to gain recognition, and citizens could finally challenge expropriation decisions in court. This marked a major evolution in the legal protection of private property in China.

Another significant evolution in China has been linked to the protection of individual liberties, particularly during the 1990s. This development was influenced by the protection of individual rights in Western and liberal countries. As we discussed previously, under the Marxist system, individual liberties were not considered real or essential. In Marx's analysis during the 19th century, the protection of individual freedoms and public liberties in liberal states was viewed as a trap for the working class. Marxist thought suggested that, while liberal states claimed to protect individual rights, they did so in a way that ultimately maintained the exploitation of workers. The core problem for workers, in Marx's view, was not about having individual liberties, but rather their dire economic conditions. He argued that the protection of such liberties served the interests of the bourgeoisie rather than addressing the workers' true needs.

In the Marxist perspective, individual liberties were seen as tools that could be used against the revolution, which was necessary to overthrow the capitalist system. The idea was that, once a communist society was established, the need for public freedoms would disappear because the society would be perfect—everyone would receive what they needed, and there would be no inequality or oppression. In this ideal society, the issues of freedom and liberties would naturally resolve themselves, making the formal protection of these rights unnecessary. As a result, during the early stages of communist rule, the protection of liberties was downplayed or restricted to protect the revolution. The primary focus was on safeguarding the communist movement, with the belief that achieving a communist society would ultimately solve the problems of freedom and justice.

This is why, in all communist countries, without exception, there was a transitional period between the old bourgeois state and the envisioned new communist society. This period, exemplified by the existence of the USSR (which lasted 72 or 73 years), was seen as a period of transition. During this time, the goal was to move from the old liberal order to the new communist society. In this phase, the revolution needed to be strict and uncompromising, especially in rejecting the application of public and individual liberties, as these freedoms were seen as tools that could be exploited by the enemies of the revolution to undermine its success. This same approach was seen in the USSR, East Germany, Poland, and still exists today in North Korea. It was also prevalent in countries like Vietnam, Albania, and other Eastern European nations. In China, for decades, there was no formal protection of individual liberties because such rights were perceived to protect the interests of the old bourgeois order and to aid those who opposed the revolution. The prevailing belief was that individual liberties would be used to resist the communist transformation, thus threatening the establishment of the new communist society.

This is why it was a significant step when, during the 1980s, the Chinese legal system—particularly the administrative law system—introduced the possibility for individuals to challenge executive orders that limited their individual rights or freedoms. For the first time, it became possible for citizens to bring such cases before a judge, marking a major shift from the previous era when individual liberties were not protected, and state authority was largely unquestionable. This change occurred gradually throughout the 1980s, with the introduction of several key legal texts and reforms.
