## Different branches of law (continue)

### Criminal law in Islamic law system (continue)

#### Religious aspect of crime (continue)

In Western countries today, unlike in the past, there is a strict separation between religion and civil life. This means that when difficulties arise in the practice of religion, these issues are not matters for state or national justice but are instead handled internally within each religious organization or church. For example, when conflicts occur within a religion—such as disputes between the majority and a minority group—the majority may make decisions affecting the minority. However, these decisions remain internal to the religious community and do not involve state or national justice.

For example, in the Catholic Church, there is the possibility of excommunication. This is a type of penalty that removes a member from the religious community, but it has no legal implications in the national justice system. In other words, it is an internal religious sanction, not a penalty within the general legal system. In Islam, however, the situation can be quite different. In states that identify as Muslim and recognize the Quran as a source of law and a primary inspiration for legislators, religious offenses can also be criminal offenses. This means that crimes against religion may be prosecuted by the national justice system, with regular courts involved in adjudicating religious matters. In some countries, such as Iran or Pakistan, there is a specific branch of justice dedicated to handling criminal offenses against religion. The extent to which this applies varies depending on the country.

Regarding this, there are two key issues: blasphemy and apostasy. Apostasy is particularly significant because it is a major concern when Muslim minorities live in non-Muslim countries. For example, in France, for the past two or three decades, the government has been trying to negotiate with various Muslim groups, representatives, and associations to draft a sort of charter or declaration regarding Islam in France. The goal of this declaration is twofold: on one hand, to affirm that Muslims are fully equal to believers of other religions and to non-believers, thereby protecting this equality and combating discrimination against Muslims. On the other hand, and this is the more challenging aspect, the aim is to ask Muslim representatives to commit to practicing Islam in a way that aligns with the general principles of law applied in France. This involves asking Muslim representatives to renounce certain principles within Islamic law that conflict with France's public order. One of the most difficult issues in this context is apostasy, which involves someone changing their religion.

> The negotiation between the French government and Muslim communities has been a complex and ongoing process, largely centered around issues of secularism, integration, and the role of Islam in French society. These negotiations often revolve around the need to balance the principles of laïcité (secularism) with the rights of the Muslim community to freely practice their religion.
>
> Key Issues:
>
> 1. **Secularism and Religious Symbols:**
>    - France's strict interpretation of secularism has led to laws banning religious symbols, such as the hijab, in public institutions, including schools. This has been a major point of contention between the government and Muslim communities, with negotiations focusing on how to respect religious freedom while maintaining secular public spaces.
>
> 2. **Creation of the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM):**
>    - In 2003, the French government helped establish the **French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM)** as an official body to represent Muslims in France. The CFCM was intended to be a dialogue partner for the government on issues such as mosque construction, halal food certification, and the training of imams. However, the council has faced challenges, including internal divisions and criticisms regarding its effectiveness and independence.
>
> 3. **Counterterrorism and Radicalization:**
>    - The rise of terrorism in France, particularly linked to Islamic extremism, has led to intensified discussions between the government and Muslim leaders on how to prevent radicalization. The government has pushed for greater oversight of mosques and Islamic schools, and there have been efforts to ensure that imams are trained in France and are aligned with French values.
>
> 4. **Charter of Principles for Islam in France:**
>    - In 2021, under pressure from President Emmanuel Macron's administration, the CFCM agreed to a "Charter of Principles for Islam in France," which affirms the compatibility of Islam with secularism and condemns political Islam. The charter also rejects foreign interference in French mosques. However, this move has been controversial within the Muslim community, with some organizations refusing to sign the charter, arguing that it unfairly targets and stigmatizes Muslims.
>
> 5. **Mosque Financing and Foreign Influence:**
>    - Another significant issue in negotiations has been the financing of mosques and the influence of foreign countries, particularly those from the Middle East and North Africa. The French government has sought to reduce foreign influence by encouraging the financing of mosques through domestic sources and promoting the training of imams in France.
>
> Challenges:
>
> - These negotiations have been marked by tension and mistrust on both sides. Many Muslims in France feel that they are being unfairly targeted by government policies, while the French government faces the challenge of addressing security concerns without alienating a significant portion of its population.

Julian the Apostate was a well-known Roman emperor who earned his title because he was initially a Christian but later decided to revert to the classical Roman religion. This example illustrates that apostasy can occur in any religion. In any faith, someone who was raised within that religion, or who converted to it, may eventually decide to change their religion, worship another deity, or even renounce religion altogether and decide they no longer believe in God.

When considering the principles of freedom of opinion and freedom of religion, which are upheld in many Western countries, the concept of religious freedom means that anyone is free to believe in whatever they choose—or not to believe at all. Religious freedom encompasses not only the right to choose one’s religion but also the right to disassociate from any religion entirely, as well as to adopt a particular philosophy or worldview. This is a crucial aspect of individual freedom, as it underscores that belief is a private matter. You are free to believe or not believe in your private life, but in public life, you cannot claim any privilege or special treatment simply because you belong to one religion or another.

> **Julian the Apostate**, also known as **Julian II** or **Julian the Philosopher**, was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 361 to 363 AD. Born in 331 AD as Flavius Claudius Julianus, he was a nephew of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor of Rome.
>
> Why "Apostate"?
>
> The title "Apostate" was given to Julian because he rejected Christianity in favor of a return to paganism, which was seen as a significant betrayal by his Christian contemporaries. Here's why:
>
> 1. **Early Life and Christianity**:
>    - Julian was raised as a Christian under the influence of his cousin, Constantius II, who was a staunch Christian and the reigning emperor at the time. Julian was educated by Christian tutors and initially outwardly practiced Christianity.
>
> 2. **Turn to Paganism**:
>    - As he grew older, Julian became increasingly disillusioned with Christianity. Influenced by his studies of classical philosophy, particularly Neoplatonism and the works of philosophers like Plotinus and Iamblichus, Julian developed a deep admiration for Roman and Greek pagan traditions.
>    - When he became emperor in 361 AD, Julian publicly renounced Christianity and sought to revive traditional Roman religious practices. His efforts included restoring pagan temples, promoting the worship of ancient gods, and attempting to curtail the influence of Christianity within the empire.
>
> 3. **Policies and Reforms**:
>    - Julian's religious policies aimed to restore the prominence of paganism and to diminish the Christian church's power. He reopened pagan temples and reinstituted old religious rites. However, rather than persecuting Christians directly, Julian sought to marginalize them by promoting religious pluralism and supporting pagan priests and philosophers.
>
> 4. **Death and Legacy**:
>    - Julian's reign was short, ending with his death in 363 AD during a military campaign against the Persian Empire. His attempts to restore paganism ultimately failed, and Christianity continued to grow in influence after his death. Christian writers later dubbed him "Julian the Apostate" to emphasize his rejection of the Christian faith.
>
> Julian's legacy is complex, as he is seen by some as a philosopher-emperor who tried to preserve classical Roman culture, while others view him as a failed ruler who could not reverse the tide of Christianization in the Roman Empire. His epithet "Apostate" reflects the deep sense of betrayal felt by the Christian community at his rejection of their faith.
>
> > **Paganism** refers to a variety of ancient polytheistic and nature-based religions that predate major monotheistic faiths like Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Pagan traditions typically involve the worship of multiple deities, often linked to natural elements such as the sun, moon, and earth, and emphasize the cycles of nature through rituals and festivals. While the term was historically used by early Christians to describe non-Christians, modern Paganism (or Neo-Paganism) has seen a revival, with movements like Wicca and Neo-Druidism drawing on these ancient practices.

In Western countries, the issue of apostasy in Islam is particularly significant because, in Islam, apostasy is forbidden. According to the Islamic Declaration of Human Rights, which has been signed by representatives from various Muslim states, Islam is considered a special religion. While these representatives acknowledge the existence of other religions, the ultimate aim is that everyone will eventually convert to Islam, as it is regarded as the true religion. In this context, other religions are accepted, but there is an inherent belief in the superiority of Islam over all other religions. So in Islamic law, apostasy is strictly forbidden, which means that if you are a Muslim, either by birth or by conversion, you are not permitted to renounce your religion. Specifically, you are not allowed to formally declare that you are no longer a believer in Islam.

In traditional Islamic law, apostasy is punishable by the death penalty in some countries, and this view is supported by the majority of Islamic scholars. It is true that during a trial, for example in Iran, there is the possibility for the accused to publicly retract their conversion to another religion. If the individual expresses regret during the trial and declares their desire to return to Islam, they may avoid the death penalty and instead face another form of punishment. Each case is assessed individually, with the specific circumstances surrounding the act of apostasy taken into account. The judge will interpret and consider these details when making a ruling. In many Muslim-majority countries, such as Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, the death penalty is commonly applied in cases of apostasy. However, in other countries like Morocco or Tunisia, while the death penalty is not enforced, there is still significant social pressure to remain within the Islamic faith.

This issue poses a significant challenge to the drafting of the charter mentioned earlier. For example, in France, the project for a Charter of Islam began in 1986 or 1987, but even after nearly 40 years, the charter has yet to be finalized. This delay is primarily due to differing views among representatives of the Muslim community in France. Some organizations are willing to accept and recognize that the fundamental principle in France is freedom of religion, which includes the right for anyone, including Muslims, to change their religion without facing repercussions for apostasy. However, other organizations maintain that Islamic law is immutable, as it was divinely revealed by the Prophet, and therefore cannot be altered. These organizations acknowledge that while it is not possible in France to prosecute or execute someone for changing their religion, as it goes against French law, they cannot formally renounce this aspect of Islamic law.

Some people argue that for Islam to adapt to Western Europe, it is necessary to have a general conference with Muslim leaders and scholars to discuss which aspects of Islamic law can remain unchanged and which need to be revised or reinterpreted through different analyses.

For example, a similar approach was taken in Catholicism with what is known as Vatican II, or the Second Vatican Council. This council, held in 1962, was a significant gathering organized by the Pope in Rome, and it lasted four years. During this time, the conference, which the Pope referred to as an *aggiornamento* (an Italian word meaning "bringing up to date" or modernization), aimed to modernize various aspects of the Catholic faith. As a result of this council, there were several changes in Catholic practice. One notable change was the shift in the Church's stance toward Jews. Traditionally, there had been a long-standing belief that Jews were responsible for the death of Christ, a belief that dated back to antiquity. However, during Vatican II, the Pope officially declared that Jews were no longer to be considered responsible for Christ's death. This marked a significant modernization, as it reversed nearly two thousand years of Church doctrine. Many other updates and reforms were also introduced into the Church at this time.

> **Vatican II**, also known as the **Second Vatican Council**, was an ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church, held from 1962 to 1965. Convened by Pope John XXIII and continued under Pope Paul VI, it was one of the most significant events in modern Church history, aimed at addressing relations between the Catholic Church and the modern world.
>
> Key Objectives and Outcomes:
>
> 1. **Modernization of the Church**:
>    - Vatican II sought to modernize the Church, making it more accessible and relevant to contemporary society. This included reforms in liturgy, such as allowing Mass to be celebrated in vernacular languages instead of Latin, making it more understandable and engaging for the laity.
>
> 2. **Ecumenism**:
>    - The council promoted greater unity among Christian denominations and improved relations with other religions. It emphasized dialogue and cooperation, acknowledging the validity of other Christian communities and showing respect for non-Christian religions.
>
> 3. **Reform of Church Practices**:
>    - Vatican II introduced significant changes in how the Church approached issues like religious freedom, the role of the laity, and the Church’s relationship with the secular world. The council documents, such as *Lumen Gentium* and *Gaudium et Spes*, laid out new directions in these areas.
>
> 4. **Renewed Emphasis on Scripture and Tradition**:
>    - The council encouraged a deeper engagement with the Bible and Church traditions, promoting the idea that both Scripture and Tradition are essential to the faith.
>
> 5. **Pastoral Orientation**:
>    - The council emphasized a pastoral approach to ministry, focusing on the needs of the faithful and the importance of engaging with the broader world.
>
> Vatican II was a transformative moment in the Catholic Church, leading to widespread changes in its liturgy, governance, and relationship with the world, significantly shaping modern Catholicism.

A similar process has occurred within Protestant churches. Many Protestant denominations have held meetings to assess societal changes and determine whether adjustments to church doctrine or beliefs were necessary on various issues. For example, for centuries, both Catholic and Protestant churches viewed abortion as a crime. However, in most Protestant churches today, there is a recognition of a woman's individual freedom to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term, including the right to an abortion. This represents a significant evolution, as for many years, abortion was strictly condemned by these churches and often led to excommunication. The same shift can be observed regarding attitudes toward homosexuality. Historically, Christian churches condemned homosexuality, citing verses in the Bible that oppose it. However, many Protestant churches have now issued statements through councils of bishops or other leaders, acknowledging that homosexuality is not a sin, is not against divine law, and have begun to accept and integrate homosexual individuals into the church. This includes the acceptance of same-sex marriages, which was previously unthinkable. Even the Catholic Church has shown signs of evolution on this issue. About six months ago, the Pope made a statement that, while the Catholic Church does not permit the official celebration of same-sex marriages, it does allow for a form of blessing for same-sex couples. This represents a step toward modernization.

What is often discussed regarding Islam is the idea that, like other major religions, Islamic practice can evolve in response to the changing world. Some Islamic scholars support the idea that certain aspects of the religion can undergo modernization and adaptation. For example, within the corpus of Islamic teachings, there are elements that are considered immutable, such as the belief that Muhammad is the Prophet and that there is only one God, Allah. These core beliefs form the foundation of the faith and cannot be altered. However, some scholars argue that other aspects, particularly certain Hadiths (sayings and actions of the Prophet), were written many centuries ago in a specific cultural and historical context that no longer exists. Therefore, they suggest that some evolution is possible in these areas. It’s important to remember that Hadiths are interpretations, and as such, there is room for re-interpretation by contemporary scholars who are recognized as highly knowledgeable. This re-interpretation might not necessarily contradict the original teachings but could represent an evolution, reflecting the differences between the world today and the world centuries ago. A portion of scholars in the Islamic community accept this perspective.

When talking about laïcité and the issue of women wearing the veil, there are three different interpretations on this matter, made by three different scholars in three different countries. The same principle could apply to the issue of blasphemy. Forty years ago, the French Minister of the Interior sought to ask representatives of Muslim countries to simply acknowledge the right of individuals to change their religion. Within the religion itself, it would still be possible to reject this practice. For instance, if someone decides to leave their religion, they could be formally excluded from the religious community. This could mean that the person would no longer receive any blessings, be able to seek help from the community, or be welcome in religious gatherings, family meetings, or community events. The idea is that while the state might recognize the right to change one's religion, the religious community could choose to disassociate from the individual who exercises that right.

For instance, consider the situation of someone who decides to change their religion. This issue has two aspects. First, there is the public aspect, meaning the impact on the national scene. In non-Muslim countries, individuals have the right to change their religion; they are free to do so, whether it means converting to another religion or choosing to have no religion at all. This decision cannot affect their public life.

On the other hand, changing one’s religion can have private consequences, depending on how the religious organization chooses to respond. For example, it could be considered acceptable for Muslim organizations to acknowledge that, in France or any other Western country, there is a principle of freedom to change one’s religion. This would mean that they do not object to this practice outside of their own countries. Thus, in traditional Muslim countries, the prohibition of changing one’s religion could still be enforced, as this restriction would apply outside of, for example, French territory. For example, religious leaders may instruct the faithful to no longer welcome anyone who has decided to leave the religion, practice another faith, or commit apostasy. In this case, it becomes a matter of social interaction rather than a legal or civil rights issue; it is a matter of private life. Scholars might say that while civil law grants individuals the right to change their religion, within the religious community, this is not acceptable. This means that if someone severs their ties with the religion, they also sever their ties with the community. Consequently, they may not be welcomed by their family or friends, even if they are close relatives.

This situation exists in some other religious groups as well. There was a documentary that aired about a year or two ago, which focused on a religious and family group living in Paris. This group has been in Paris for about 200 years, originating around the time of the French Revolution or the era of the Empire. It consists of two or three families who decided to cut off ties with the outside world. They marry within the group, live within the group, and have developed a special system of solidarity among themselves. What is remarkable is that they have managed to maintain this insular community in the heart of a large city like Paris for two centuries. Today, there are about two or three thousand people living in the same area in Paris, interacting only with each other. The documentary highlighted that one of the main rules of the group is that if you leave, it’s final. If you choose to leave, you can never return to the group, and families are prohibited from seeing relatives who have left. From the perspective of civil law, this practice is neither fair nor legal, as individual freedom includes the right to be with your family, to leave, and to choose whom you want to see. However, within this community, such rules are considered the norm. If you are part of the group, you must follow its rules; if you choose not to, you must leave, and once you’re out, there’s no coming back. We can draw an analogy with the concept of apostasy. One could imagine a scenario where apostasy is accepted under public law, but within the religious community, there is a self-organized system where those who do not follow the rules are no longer considered members of the group.

This is exactly what happened in the Christian churches, particularly regarding homosexuality. For decades, individuals who were homosexual were not allowed to fully participate in certain practices within the church. While some participation was possible, not all aspects of religious life were accessible to them. For example, there was no recognition of religious weddings between two people of the same sex. However, in many Protestant churches today, such weddings are now possible, demonstrating that evolution within religious practices can occur.

Another aspect of religious criminal law in Islam concerns blasphemy. Blasphemy, in general—not only in Islam but in the broader sense—refers to any act of questioning or challenging sacred texts or holy concepts. In essence, blasphemy involves using freedom of speech to contest or criticize what is considered sacred by believers, including holy books, religious dogma, or fundamental principles of faith.

In Western liberal countries, blasphemy is not treated as a criminal offense. This is because, in these societies, religion is primarily considered a private matter, and acts of blasphemy do not have legal consequences in public life. State justice systems are not involved in prosecuting blasphemy. To be clear, blasphemy is not included in the criminal code of these countries, as it falls under the protection of freedom of speech.

An example of this issue of blasphemy is seen in the controversy surrounding the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. There was an incident that took place in Denmark about 20 years ago when a newspaper published drawings depicting the Prophet Muhammad. In Islam, it is forbidden to create representations of the human body, face, or animals because it is considered blasphemous to depict what God has created. This is why, in Islamic art, especially in the Arab tradition, you often see geometric patterns and symbols rather than representations of people, animals, or natural forms. However, there is an exception in Persian art, where it is more common to see such depictions, including human figures and animals, due to the influence of Persian cultural traditions.

The controversy in Denmark arose because Denmark is not a Muslim country, and it upholds the principle of freedom of speech, which includes the freedom of artistic expression. When the caricatures were published, the newspaper’s editor, journalists, and the artist who created the drawings received threats, including fatwas calling for their deaths. This sparked a debate in Denmark, a very liberal and open society, about where the line should be drawn between respecting the principles of a liberal society—such as freedom of speech and artistic expression—and respecting the beliefs of minorities, in this case, the Muslim minority. The central question was whether the freedom of speech should be limited out of respect for Islamic prohibitions against depicting the Prophet, or whether the freedom of speech should remain a fundamental principle of Danish society, with the expectation that minorities must accept that religion is considered a matter of private life, not public life, in Western countries. The argument was that while private believers might be offended by such a depiction, they have the right to express their discontent by refusing to purchase the newspaper, calling for a boycott, or expressing their views, but they cannot demand legal penalties against the newspaper, its editor, or its journalists.

We had a similar debate in France regarding the Charlie Hebdo case. Charlie Hebdo is a newspaper that was established after the 1968 student riots. It originates from a radical left-wing perspective and is associated with a form of libertarianism—specifically, left-wing libertarianism. Not anarchism in the sense of violent attacks, but rather a strong belief in individual freedom, often with a critical stance against the state and the police. Charlie Hebdo is known for its ironic and satirical tone. While the newspaper publishes serious articles, it is also known for its caricatures and jokes, using humor and irony to engage in public debate. It’s not a traditional newspaper like The New Yorker, Tribune, The Times, or Le Monde. Instead, it's a satirical publication that uses humor to highlight societal issues, though its content is not solely for entertainment; it often addresses serious topics through satire. About 10 years ago, following the controversy in Denmark, Charlie Hebdo published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. This led to widespread protests in several Muslim countries and resulted in fatwas being issued against the journalists. There was a tragic attack on the newspaper’s office by radical Muslims, during which several journalists, cartoonists, and writers were killed. This event sparked a significant debate in France: where should the line be drawn between freedom of expression and respect for religious beliefs?

> The **Charlie Hebdo case** refers to the tragic attack on the offices of the French satirical weekly newspaper *Charlie Hebdo* in Paris on January 7, 2015. The attack was carried out by two brothers, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, who were armed with assault rifles and other weapons. They stormed the newspaper's office, killing 12 people, including prominent cartoonists, the editor-in-chief, and other staff members, as well as a police officer.
>
> Background:
>
> *Charlie Hebdo* is known for its provocative and often controversial cartoons, including those that satirize religion, politics, and various social issues. The magazine had previously published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, which angered many in the Muslim community and led to several threats against the magazine. The attackers claimed they were avenging the Prophet Muhammad for the cartoons published by *Charlie Hebdo*.
>
> Aftermath:
>
> The attack shocked the world and sparked widespread debates about freedom of speech, the right to satire, and the limits of religious offense. Following the attack, millions of people around the world participated in rallies and demonstrations under the slogan "Je Suis Charlie" (I am Charlie) to express solidarity with the victims and support for free speech.
>
> The incident also led to increased security measures in France and raised concerns about Islamic extremism in Europe. The surviving staff of *Charlie Hebdo* continued to publish the magazine, and its first issue after the attack featured a cover with a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad holding a "Je Suis Charlie" sign, under the headline "Tout est pardonné" (All is forgiven).
>
> The Charlie Hebdo case remains a significant event in discussions about freedom of expression, religious tolerance, and the challenges of living in a multicultural society.

In France, the response to this issue was more definitive compared to Denmark, where no final resolution was reached. In Denmark, the debate centered around the idea that while freedom of speech is crucial, it is not absolute, and there is also a need to respect the beliefs of members of society. This means that if a religion prohibits the depiction of God or the Prophet, that prohibition should be respected. It was suggested that while one could write articles about religion, criticize certain aspects—such as the treatment of women or views on homosexuality—argue, and explain, one should not offend. The distinction made in Denmark was between arguing, explaining, and offending. The consensus was that offense should be avoided, as offensive remarks would not be accepted if directed at Christianity or Judaism, and therefore, should not be directed at any other religion.

In France, the answer was more specific due to the principle of laïcité. Additionally, the French legal system regarding the press is very liberal. In France, courts and judges place a very high level of protection on freedom of expression and publishing, although it is not absolute. The only restriction on freedom of expression in the French press is when it crosses into the realm of criminal offense. For example, it is illegal to promote racist, sexist, or homophobic positions, or to attack a group of people, especially those who are vulnerable. Generalizations such as "Jews are," "Muslims are," or "Christians are" are not allowed. However, there is a strong protection for the freedom of expression, especially in the context of satire and caricature. This means that when someone creates a caricature or writes with irony, the reader is expected to understand the ironic intent, and the author has the right to be ironic. As long as the expression does not target a specific community or individual but rather addresses a general subject, it is permissible. In the case of the caricatures published by Charlie Hebdo, the position taken was that no one should consider themselves publicly offended by the drawings.

In the French criminal justice system, there is no law against blasphemy. Blasphemy is not considered a criminal offense because religion is regarded as a private matter. This means that, as a private believer, you may feel offended, disagree with the content, write a protest, organize demonstrations, or call for a boycott. You can express your displeasure in various ways, but you cannot impose any legal sanctions against those who wrote the book, article, or created the drawings. The principle is that as long as there is no element of racism, homophobia, or sexism in the expression, it is permitted. In the French legal system, as well as in the broader Western legal framework, depicting the Prophet, for example, is not considered an offense because it does not qualify as blasphemy. Blasphemy, defined as an expression against what is considered holy, is not recognized in Western countries. Holiness is regarded as part of private life and private beliefs, not a matter of public concern. Therefore, legal action cannot be taken against blasphemy. Additionally, not only is it impossible to prosecute someone for blasphemy, but it is also impermissible to take any form of private justice against those exercising their freedom of expression.

This situation is very different in some Muslim countries. In countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, where Islam is the official religion, Islam is enshrined in the legal framework and occupies a central role in the public sphere. This means that offenses against Islam can be prosecuted by the national justice system because they are considered offenses against the state, given that Islam is the state religion. As a result, the treatment of blasphemy in these countries is entirely different from that in Western countries. In some Muslim countries, blasphemy is not only a religious offense but also a criminal one that can be prosecuted by the national legal system. Additionally, in some of these countries, there are specialized religious judges who form a distinct branch of the judiciary to handle such cases.

In countries where blasphemy is prosecuted under criminal law, offenses against religion are treated as part of the criminal code, and the consequences are often severe. The application of these laws varies significantly from one country to another. In some countries, blasphemy may be punished with imprisonment or a financial penalty. Additionally, in many countries, similar to the case with apostasy, there is an option for retraction. A person accused of blasphemy can appear before the court, express remorse, repent, and retract their previous statements. This may result in a lesser punishment compared to someone who does not retract.

However, in some countries, the death penalty can be applied for blasphemy, with methods of execution including whipping, hanging, decapitation, or, in certain cases, stoning. The definition of blasphemy can also vary between countries. For example, in some places, failing to observe the practices of Ramadan is considered blasphemy and is punishable by law. In others, such as Morocco, not observing Ramadan is socially unacceptable but may not necessarily result in judicial punishment, though there can be significant social pressure to conform. The approach to blasphemy, therefore, differs greatly from one country to another.

Another aspect of this issue concerns whether these laws apply to non-Muslims. In some countries, during Ramadan, it is forbidden for anyone, regardless of their religion, to eat or drink in public. For example, in Afghanistan, it is illegal to eat or drink in public during daylight hours, and even non-Muslims can be prosecuted for doing so. In contrast, other countries mandate the observance of Ramadan only for Muslims, while non-Muslims are not required to follow these practices. This is particularly common in countries with significant tourism industries. In such countries, local laws often permit foreigners to decide whether or not they wish to observe Ramadan. As a result, the rules are enforced for local residents who follow the religion, but they do not apply to foreign visitors.

The key point to remember about Islamic law is that there are essentially two types. On one hand, there is the theoretical Islamic law, which encompasses all the legal principles derived from the 600 verses of the Quran, the Hadiths, and various other sources. This theoretical law serves as a general framework and inspiration for Islamic jurists. On the other hand, there is the practical application of Islamic law, which varies from country to country. In different countries, the implementation of Islamic law can vary significantly across various areas, such as criminal law, religious law, public law, and administrative law. Some countries adhere closely to traditional Islamic law as the primary legal framework, where the application of Islamic law follows very traditional practices. In other countries, traditional Islamic law serves more as an inspiration for legislators, while the actual laws are those passed by the parliament or administrative orders issued by the government. Although these laws and orders are influenced by the general principles of Islam, they are often specific and may also be influenced by other legal systems.

For example, the influence of the continental law system or the common law system can be seen in countries that were colonized and adopted these legal frameworks. In conclusion, it’s important to recognize that Islamic law serves as a guiding framework. It comprises various texts and principles, with a hierarchy where the Quran holds the highest authority, followed by the Hadith, interpretations, and so on. These principles are subject to different interpretations and analyses by scholars, judges, or imams. This means that the same principle may be interpreted differently in various contexts, leading to variations in the application of the law across different countries. As a result, you might find a very strict application of traditional rules in some countries, while in others, a more liberal interpretation may prevail. Therefore, when discussing Islamic law, it is essential to distinguish between the general principles and the specific, practical applications that vary from country to country.

## Judicial system in Muslim countries

The judicial systems in various countries can differ significantly, depending on whether they are influenced by the common law system or the continental law system. For instance, in former colonies such as Algeria, Morocco, or Tunisia, the judicial system often operates under rules very similar to those of the French legal system. In these countries, you typically have a panel of three judges presiding over a case, whereas in common law systems, it's more common to have a single judge. This difference also extends to how the prosecution process is conducted. In countries influenced by the common law system, the judge typically leads the prosecution alongside the prosecutor and listens to the arguments from both parties. In contrast, in the continental law system, the judge plays a more active role during the trial itself.

> In the continental law system, which is used in many European countries and other parts of the world, trials are often handled by a panel of judges rather than a single judge or a jury, especially in more serious or complex cases. This system is characteristic of what is known as **inquisitorial systems** of justice, as opposed to the **adversarial system** common in common law jurisdictions like the United States and the United Kingdom.

>    - In many continental law countries, particularly in higher courts or in cases of significant complexity, a panel of three judges or more may preside over the trial. These judges are responsible for both investigating the facts and making a legal decision.
>    - For example, in France and Germany, certain criminal and civil cases are heard by a panel of three judges. This setup is meant to ensure thorough consideration of the case and mitigate individual bias.
>
> 2. **Role of Judges**:
>    - Judges in the continental system play a more active role in gathering evidence, questioning witnesses, and guiding the trial. They are not just arbiters between two opposing sides but are directly involved in the investigation and determination of the facts.
>
> 3. **Types of Cases**:
>    - The number of judges can vary depending on the type of case and its seriousness. For less severe cases, a single judge might preside, while more serious criminal cases or complex civil matters typically involve a panel.
>
> Examples:
>
> - **France**: In serious criminal cases (Cour d'assises), trials are handled by a panel of three professional judges along with a jury. For civil matters, especially appeals, a three-judge panel is common.
> - **Germany**: In the German legal system, major criminal cases are usually heard by a panel of professional judges, sometimes combined with lay judges (Schöffen), depending on the severity of the crime.
>
> This system of using a panel of judges in continental law ensures a more collaborative judicial process, aiming to enhance the accuracy and fairness of the trial.

In addition, some Islamic countries apply a more traditional legal system. In Islamic law, the judge is referred to as a Qadi. In many countries, Qadis are responsible for enforcing religious law. This means that there are judges within the general justice system, as well as Qadis who specialize in handling religious cases. In many Muslim countries, there is a clear distinction between what we might call the regular justice system—covering civil, criminal, and sometimes administrative law—and the system that handles religious matters.

In the context of administrative law, it's important to remember that in the continental law system, there is a division between civil and criminal law on one hand and administrative law on the other. In contrast, the common law system typically includes only civil and criminal law, with administrative matters being handled by commissions rather than courts. For example, in the United States, commissions like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) manage administrative issues related to competition and communications. These commissions, while influential in the application of administrative law, are not courts, and their members are not judges. They operate with specific groups that handle enforcement. Conversely, in the continental law system, there is a distinct separation between the judicial system and the administrative court system. Administrative courts in this system are true courts, meaning that their members are magistrates who enjoy the protections afforded to judicial officers. These courts issue judgments rather than merely making decisions or producing reports, reinforcing their role as integral components of the judicial system.

In some Muslim countries, the legal system may align with either the common law or the continental law system, depending on the country's legal tradition. Regardless of the system in place, there are judges as well as Qadis who specialize in religious matters. For example, in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, there are no juries in criminal cases. The court is composed solely of judges, who make decisions directly without the involvement of jurors—citizens selected to assist in the administration of justice. Furthermore, judges in these countries are not bound by the obligation to follow legal precedents. This means that in traditional Muslim countries, a judge has the discretion to assess each case individually, considering both the general principles of Islamic law and the specific circumstances of the case at hand.

In Muslim countries, judges typically work with a system of analogy. They will examine the general literature of Islamic law to find examples of similar cases. The judge will also review the opinions of scholars to gather relevant insights. After conducting this research, the judge synthesizes this information to determine the most appropriate solution for the case at hand. If the judge concludes that there is no existing answer in the sources consulted, they have the authority to develop their own solution and make an original decision. This means that, in the future, other judges have the option to either follow this new solution or revert to traditional interpretations. This flexibility allows for a dynamic approach to applying Islamic law, where precedents are not strictly binding, and judges can adapt to new circumstances.

In many Islamic countries, there may not be a specific legal codification, although this varies depending on the country. In countries influenced by the continental law system, such as Nigeria, there are legal codes in place, often inspired by the French system. However, in other Muslim countries where codification is absent, judges must draw from various sources to make their rulings. This means that a judge might consult the Quran, the Hadith, and any laws that have been passed by the country's parliament. The judge then reviews these sources to determine the appropriate solution for the case at hand.

In the Islamic legal system, trials are primarily conducted orally. This means that there is not a significant reliance on written texts or documents, and much of the legal process involves oral confrontations. Consequently, witnesses play a crucial role in the Islamic legal system. Noting that in some countries, the testimony of a man is considered twice as important as that of a woman, or that the testimony of a Muslim might be valued more highly than that of a non-Muslim, depending on the country. This emphasis on witnesses stems from the fact that the legal process is largely oral.

While documents such as contracts are important, particularly in cases involving substantial transactions or dealings with foreign companies, in many everyday situations in some Muslim countries, written contracts may not be common. For example, in local matters such as renting a house or hiring a carpenter, agreements are often made orally between the parties involved, with witnesses present to affirm the terms. The contract is essentially formed through the mutual agreement of the parties, without the necessity of a written document.

This traditional practice is currently evolving, largely due to fiscal reasons. Without a written contract, it is difficult for tax authorities to gather the necessary information to assess taxes. As a result, many Muslim countries are now encouraging or requiring people to sign contracts. A written document allows the administration to determine, for instance, the applicable taxes or the financial obligations of the parties involved. For example, if a carpenter operates without written contracts, it becomes easier to underreport income and evade taxes. To counter this, some Muslim countries are now pushing for written agreements to ensure transparency in financial transactions and to facilitate the proper collection of taxes.

Traditionally, contracts were not commonly used, which highlights the importance of witnesses and explains why the legal process is predominantly oral. In these cases, the only written document produced is the final judgment, which includes the decision and relevant details. Prior to that, there is minimal paperwork involved, as much of the process is conducted orally. This approach is particularly common in everyday cases, such as disputes between neighbors, minor accidents, small financial matters, or informal contracts. These types of cases, which involve relatively minor issues or small amounts of money, are typically handled through oral proceedings.

It's interesting to observe this difference because, in countries that follow the continental law system, there is a strong emphasis on documentation. This system relies heavily on paper, resulting in a multitude of documents and requirements to submit various forms and proofs. For example, in countries like France or Italy, even a relatively simple legal case may involve an extensive file filled with paperwork. Each party tends to submit numerous documents, hoping that these will support their case and lead to a favorable judgment. Additionally, judges in these systems often request expert opinions or additional evidence, further contributing to the volume of paperwork involved.

If we compare this with the legal systems in Muslim countries, the process is quite different. In these systems, the only substantial documentation produced is the final judgment, with minimal paperwork leading up to it. The burden of proof largely relies on witnesses, and an important element of the Muslim legal system is the use of oaths. When a judge is uncertain about a decision, an oath may be required. For instance, a witness or one of the parties involved may be asked to swear an oath on the Quran. In this context, making a false oath is considered blasphemy, a serious offense that can be severely punished. This is a key distinction in the Islamic legal system, where oaths carry significant weight and are taken very seriously. In contrast, in many other countries, such as France, witnesses are also required to take an oath during criminal trials, pledging to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. While this is a strict obligation and making a false oath can lead to prosecution and penalties, it is not considered blasphemy. However, in Islamic law, a false oath is seen as a grave offense because it involves swearing on the Quran. As a result, people generally take oaths very seriously, as making a false oath can lead to severe consequences.

> In Islamic law, the process of taking an oath as a witness is a solemn and highly significant act, reflecting the gravity with which the judicial system treats the giving of testimony. Here are the detailed aspects of the oath-taking process in Islamic law:
>
> 1. **The Nature of the Oath (Yamin)**:
>    - The oath, or "Yamin" in Arabic, is a declaration made by a witness invoking the name of Allah, swearing to tell the truth. This is not just a legal formality but a religious obligation, as the witness is made acutely aware that they are under oath before God, who is all-seeing and all-knowing.
>    - The typical formulation of the oath might be: "I swear by Allah that I will tell the truth." This direct invocation of God emphasizes the religious duty to speak truthfully.
>
> 2. **Scriptural Basis**:
>    - The Quran emphasizes the importance of truthful testimony in several verses. For instance:
>      - Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:106) states: "O you who have believed, when [the time] death approaches any of you, [appoint] two just men from among you as witnesses when you make bequests; or two others from outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death should strike you. Detain them after the prayer, and let them both swear by Allah if you doubt [their testimony, saying], 'We will not exchange it [i.e., our oath] for a price, even if he should be a near relative, and we will not withhold the testimony of Allah. Indeed, we would then be of the sinful.'"
>      - Surah Al-Baqarah (2:283) also addresses the importance of witnesses and the integrity required in their testimonies.
>
> 3. **Legal and Moral Consequences**:
>    - **False Oath (Yamin Ghamus)**: Taking a false oath is considered a grievous sin in Islam, known as "Yamin Ghamus," which literally means a "dipping oath," referring to one that plunges the person into sin. The Prophet Muhammad condemned false testimony and false oaths, linking them to severe consequences in the afterlife.
>    - Islamic jurisprudence categorizes bearing false witness as a major sin (kabirah), and it can lead to both worldly penalties (depending on the legal context) and spiritual repercussions, such as divine punishment.
>
> 4. **Contextual Application in Courts**:
>    - In Islamic courts, the procedure often requires the witness to take an oath before giving their testimony. The judge (qadi) may ask the witness to swear to Allah that they are telling the truth. This is particularly critical in cases where the testimony directly affects the outcome of the case, such as in matters of financial disputes, accusations of serious crimes, or familial issues.
>    - In some cases, if one party swears an oath and the other party refuses to do so, the judgment may be made in favor of the party that swore the oath.
>
> 5. **Cultural Variations**:
>    - While the basic principles of oath-taking are consistent across Islamic jurisprudence, cultural practices may influence how these oaths are administered in different countries or regions. For instance, in some communities, additional rituals or phrases may be added to the oath to emphasize its seriousness.
>
> 6. **Role of the Judge**:
>    - The judge in Islamic law plays a crucial role in ensuring that the oath is taken seriously. The judge may remind the witness of the religious and legal importance of their testimony and the severe consequences of lying under oath.
>
> This detailed framework shows how the oath in Islamic law is deeply intertwined with religious beliefs and judicial practices, underscoring the profound responsibility placed on witnesses to uphold the truth.

## Introduction of the Chinese law system

When discussing the Chinese legal system, my presentation will focus on mainland China, excluding Taiwan, which has a legal system that can sometimes differ. I will specifically address the general legal system in mainland China and will not cover the systems that exist in certain regions. For example, I will not discuss Hong Kong, which, after returning to China from British colonial rule, was granted a special legal system. This system is a blend of the former British-influenced legal framework, particularly in business law, and the legal system of mainland China. The same applies to Macau, which was a Portuguese colony before it returned to China. Both regions have unique legal systems due to their special status. Additionally, I will not cover the specific legal status of certain cities, such as Shanghai, which also has a special legal framework with particular nuances, especially in business law. My focus will be on the general legal system in mainland China.

The Chinese legal system has recently undergone changes with the introduction of a new civil code in January 2021. This new code has been implemented in response to China's expanding international business activities, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative, which has led to increased economic activities by Chinese companies in various countries. Consequently, the civil code has been adapted to align with these developments.

> The new Chinese Civil Code, which came into effect on January 1, 2021, marks a significant milestone in China's legal system. It is the first comprehensive civil code in the country’s history and consolidates various existing civil laws into a unified code, covering a wide range of areas such as property rights, contracts, torts, marriage and family, inheritance, and personal rights.
>
> Key Features of the Civil Code:
>
> 1. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
>    - The Civil Code is divided into seven parts: General Principles, Property, Contracts, Personality Rights, Marriage and Family, Inheritance, and Tort Liability. It integrates and modernizes previous laws, such as the Marriage Law, Inheritance Law, and the General Principles of Civil Law, among others.
>
> 2. **Protection of Personality Rights**:
>    - One of the significant innovations of the Civil Code is the introduction of a dedicated section on personality rights, which includes provisions to protect personal dignity, privacy, and individual image rights. This reflects an increased emphasis on personal rights in response to the growing public concern over privacy and personal data protection.
>
> 3. **Marriage and Family**:
>    - The Civil Code maintains traditional aspects of marriage law but introduces changes, such as the requirement for a 30-day cooling-off period before a divorce can be finalized, aimed at reducing impulsive divorces.
>
> 4. **Property Rights**:
>    - The code strengthens the protection of private property rights, reflecting China's economic evolution towards greater recognition of individual property ownership. It also provides clearer regulations regarding property inheritance and real estate ownership.
>
> 5. **Contract and Tort Law**:
>    - The Civil Code consolidates and expands the rules on contracts and torts, providing a more comprehensive legal framework for civil disputes. It aims to enhance the enforceability of contracts and clarify the legal responsibilities in tort cases.
>
> 6. **Social and Economic Reforms**:
>    - The code supports ongoing social and economic reforms by establishing clearer rules for civil behavior and transactions, aligning with China’s broader goals of legal modernization and the rule of law.
>
> Impact and Significance:
>
> The enactment of the Civil Code is seen as a crucial step in strengthening the rule of law in China. It provides a more systematic and coherent legal framework for civil matters, which is expected to improve legal certainty and stability in civil relations. The code also reflects China’s evolving social and economic conditions, incorporating modern concepts of rights and responsibilities.
>
> The Chinese Civil Code of 2021 represents a major development in China's legal system, aiming to provide a comprehensive legal foundation for civil relations in the modern era.

It is also important to note that the Chinese legal system is inspired by the continental law system, meaning it operates based on written laws. For instance, the legal framework includes various codes that guide legal processes and regulations.

## The sources of Chinese law system

1. Written legislative law
   - Written legislative law refers to the laws that are passed by the national parliament and enforced by the national government. This is why we can say that China operates under the continental law system, where the written laws enacted by legislative bodies hold primary importance.

2. The interpretation of law by the national judicial court
   - The second source of law in China is the interpretation of law by the national judicial courts, and the significance of this judicial interpretation is increasing. Historically, during the era of the strict communist system, the Chinese legal framework was primarily based on the laws passed by the legislative body, the parliament. While there was, of course, a judicial system and trials to interpret the law, the role of judges in interpreting and adapting the law was quite limited, as outlined in traditional communist texts globally. However, with the liberalization of the economy in China, the role of judges has become more prominent, similar to what has happened in many other countries. As a result, the importance of judicial interpretation of laws and contracts by judges has also been increasing.

3. Customs
   - The third source of law in the Chinese continental law system is provided by Article No. 10 of the Civil Code. According to this article, judges can refer to customs to resolve certain cases, but they must adhere to very strict conditions. The first condition is that the custom cannot contradict the principles of public order or fair social behavior. The second condition is that a judge may only refer to customs if the law does not provide a solution to the issue at hand. In other words, if the law is silent on a particular matter, the judge can consider customs, but only if these customs do not violate public order or principles of fair social behavior.
   - This use of customs is primarily applied in specific areas within the Republic that have a system of home rule, often because minority populations live there. For example, in matters of family law, judges may sometimes refer to local customs. However, this is only permissible if the customs do not conflict with public order or fair social behavior.

4. Specific rules for local minorities
   - The fourth source of law relates to the fact that in certain local areas where minorities reside, local authorities may be granted permission by national law to adapt specific rules that might otherwise contradict the laws enacted by the national parliament. This is a form of home rule. In such cases, local authorities are required to apply the local customs recognized within their jurisdiction. This essentially means that the third source—customs—is not as significant on its own, because when customs are applied, it is usually through their incorporation into local law by local authorities. The intention behind Article 10 was to allow judges in local areas to apply local customs, especially for minority communities. However, in practice, the local authorities often take on this role by enforcing specific laws for their areas that are inspired by and respectful of local customs. As a result, while the application of specific customs by judges does occur, it is not as common because local authorities have already integrated these customs into the local legal framework.

> Article 10
>
> Civil disputes shall be resolved in accordance with law. Where the law does not specify, custom may be applied, provided that public order and good morals may not be offended.
