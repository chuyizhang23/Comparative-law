## Different branches of law (continue)

### Criminal law in Islamic law system (continue)

#### Religious aspect of crime (continue)

In Western countries today, unlike in the past, there is a strict separation between religion and civil life. This means that when difficulties arise in the practice of religion, these issues are not matters for state or national justice but are instead handled internally within each religious organization or church. For example, when conflicts occur within a religion—such as disputes between the majority and a minority group—the majority may make decisions affecting the minority. However, these decisions remain internal to the religious community and do not involve state or national justice.

For example, in the Catholic Church, there is the possibility of excommunication. This is a type of penalty that removes a member from the religious community, but it has no legal implications in the national justice system. In other words, it is an internal religious sanction, not a penalty within the general legal system. In Islam, however, the situation can be quite different. In states that identify as Muslim and recognize the Quran as a source of law and a primary inspiration for legislators, religious offenses can also be criminal offenses. This means that crimes against religion may be prosecuted by the national justice system, with regular courts involved in adjudicating religious matters. In some countries, such as Iran or Pakistan, there is a specific branch of justice dedicated to handling criminal offenses against religion. The extent to which this applies varies depending on the country.

Regarding this, there are two key issues: blasphemy and apostasy. Apostasy is particularly significant because it is a major concern when Muslim minorities live in non-Muslim countries. For example, in France, for the past two or three decades, the government has been trying to negotiate with various Muslim groups, representatives, and associations to draft a sort of charter or declaration regarding Islam in France. The goal of this declaration is twofold: on one hand, to affirm that Muslims are fully equal to believers of other religions and to non-believers, thereby protecting this equality and combating discrimination against Muslims. On the other hand, and this is the more challenging aspect, the aim is to ask Muslim representatives to commit to practicing Islam in a way that aligns with the general principles of law applied in France. This involves asking Muslim representatives to renounce certain principles within Islamic law that conflict with France's public order. One of the most difficult issues in this context is apostasy, which involves someone changing their religion.

> The negotiation between the French government and Muslim communities has been a complex and ongoing process, largely centered around issues of secularism, integration, and the role of Islam in French society. These negotiations often revolve around the need to balance the principles of laïcité (secularism) with the rights of the Muslim community to freely practice their religion.
>
> Key Issues:
>
> 1. **Secularism and Religious Symbols:**
>    - France's strict interpretation of secularism has led to laws banning religious symbols, such as the hijab, in public institutions, including schools. This has been a major point of contention between the government and Muslim communities, with negotiations focusing on how to respect religious freedom while maintaining secular public spaces.
>
> 2. **Creation of the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM):**
>    - In 2003, the French government helped establish the **French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM)** as an official body to represent Muslims in France. The CFCM was intended to be a dialogue partner for the government on issues such as mosque construction, halal food certification, and the training of imams. However, the council has faced challenges, including internal divisions and criticisms regarding its effectiveness and independence.
>
> 3. **Counterterrorism and Radicalization:**
>    - The rise of terrorism in France, particularly linked to Islamic extremism, has led to intensified discussions between the government and Muslim leaders on how to prevent radicalization. The government has pushed for greater oversight of mosques and Islamic schools, and there have been efforts to ensure that imams are trained in France and are aligned with French values.
>
> 4. **Charter of Principles for Islam in France:**
>    - In 2021, under pressure from President Emmanuel Macron's administration, the CFCM agreed to a "Charter of Principles for Islam in France," which affirms the compatibility of Islam with secularism and condemns political Islam. The charter also rejects foreign interference in French mosques. However, this move has been controversial within the Muslim community, with some organizations refusing to sign the charter, arguing that it unfairly targets and stigmatizes Muslims.
>
> 5. **Mosque Financing and Foreign Influence:**
>    - Another significant issue in negotiations has been the financing of mosques and the influence of foreign countries, particularly those from the Middle East and North Africa. The French government has sought to reduce foreign influence by encouraging the financing of mosques through domestic sources and promoting the training of imams in France.
>
> Challenges:
>
> - These negotiations have been marked by tension and mistrust on both sides. Many Muslims in France feel that they are being unfairly targeted by government policies, while the French government faces the challenge of addressing security concerns without alienating a significant portion of its population.

Julian the Apostate was a well-known Roman emperor who earned his title because he was initially a Christian but later decided to revert to the classical Roman religion. This example illustrates that apostasy can occur in any religion. In any faith, someone who was raised within that religion, or who converted to it, may eventually decide to change their religion, worship another deity, or even renounce religion altogether and decide they no longer believe in God.

When considering the principles of freedom of opinion and freedom of religion, which are upheld in many Western countries, the concept of religious freedom means that anyone is free to believe in whatever they choose—or not to believe at all. Religious freedom encompasses not only the right to choose one’s religion but also the right to disassociate from any religion entirely, as well as to adopt a particular philosophy or worldview. This is a crucial aspect of individual freedom, as it underscores that belief is a private matter. You are free to believe or not believe in your private life, but in public life, you cannot claim any privilege or special treatment simply because you belong to one religion or another.

> **Julian the Apostate**, also known as **Julian II** or **Julian the Philosopher**, was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 361 to 363 AD. Born in 331 AD as Flavius Claudius Julianus, he was a nephew of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor of Rome.
>
> Why "Apostate"?
>
> The title "Apostate" was given to Julian because he rejected Christianity in favor of a return to paganism, which was seen as a significant betrayal by his Christian contemporaries. Here's why:
>
> 1. **Early Life and Christianity**:
>    - Julian was raised as a Christian under the influence of his cousin, Constantius II, who was a staunch Christian and the reigning emperor at the time. Julian was educated by Christian tutors and initially outwardly practiced Christianity.
>
> 2. **Turn to Paganism**:
>    - As he grew older, Julian became increasingly disillusioned with Christianity. Influenced by his studies of classical philosophy, particularly Neoplatonism and the works of philosophers like Plotinus and Iamblichus, Julian developed a deep admiration for Roman and Greek pagan traditions.
>    - When he became emperor in 361 AD, Julian publicly renounced Christianity and sought to revive traditional Roman religious practices. His efforts included restoring pagan temples, promoting the worship of ancient gods, and attempting to curtail the influence of Christianity within the empire.
>
> 3. **Policies and Reforms**:
>    - Julian's religious policies aimed to restore the prominence of paganism and to diminish the Christian church's power. He reopened pagan temples and reinstituted old religious rites. However, rather than persecuting Christians directly, Julian sought to marginalize them by promoting religious pluralism and supporting pagan priests and philosophers.
>
> 4. **Death and Legacy**:
>    - Julian's reign was short, ending with his death in 363 AD during a military campaign against the Persian Empire. His attempts to restore paganism ultimately failed, and Christianity continued to grow in influence after his death. Christian writers later dubbed him "Julian the Apostate" to emphasize his rejection of the Christian faith.
>
> Julian's legacy is complex, as he is seen by some as a philosopher-emperor who tried to preserve classical Roman culture, while others view him as a failed ruler who could not reverse the tide of Christianization in the Roman Empire. His epithet "Apostate" reflects the deep sense of betrayal felt by the Christian community at his rejection of their faith.
>
> > **Paganism** refers to a variety of ancient polytheistic and nature-based religions that predate major monotheistic faiths like Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Pagan traditions typically involve the worship of multiple deities, often linked to natural elements such as the sun, moon, and earth, and emphasize the cycles of nature through rituals and festivals. While the term was historically used by early Christians to describe non-Christians, modern Paganism (or Neo-Paganism) has seen a revival, with movements like Wicca and Neo-Druidism drawing on these ancient practices.

In Western countries, the issue of apostasy in Islam is particularly significant because, in Islam, apostasy is forbidden. According to the Islamic Declaration of Human Rights, which has been signed by representatives from various Muslim states, Islam is considered a special religion. While these representatives acknowledge the existence of other religions, the ultimate aim is that everyone will eventually convert to Islam, as it is regarded as the true religion. In this context, other religions are accepted, but there is an inherent belief in the superiority of Islam over all other religions. So in Islamic law, apostasy is strictly forbidden, which means that if you are a Muslim, either by birth or by conversion, you are not permitted to renounce your religion. Specifically, you are not allowed to formally declare that you are no longer a believer in Islam.

In traditional Islamic law, apostasy is punishable by the death penalty in some countries, and this view is supported by the majority of Islamic scholars. It is true that during a trial, for example in Iran, there is the possibility for the accused to publicly retract their conversion to another religion. If the individual expresses regret during the trial and declares their desire to return to Islam, they may avoid the death penalty and instead face another form of punishment. Each case is assessed individually, with the specific circumstances surrounding the act of apostasy taken into account. The judge will interpret and consider these details when making a ruling. In many Muslim-majority countries, such as Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, the death penalty is commonly applied in cases of apostasy. However, in other countries like Morocco or Tunisia, while the death penalty is not enforced, there is still significant social pressure to remain within the Islamic faith.

This issue poses a significant challenge to the drafting of the charter mentioned earlier. For example, in France, the project for a Charter of Islam began in 1986 or 1987, but even after nearly 40 years, the charter has yet to be finalized. This delay is primarily due to differing views among representatives of the Muslim community in France. Some organizations are willing to accept and recognize that the fundamental principle in France is freedom of religion, which includes the right for anyone, including Muslims, to change their religion without facing repercussions for apostasy. However, other organizations maintain that Islamic law is immutable, as it was divinely revealed by the Prophet, and therefore cannot be altered. These organizations acknowledge that while it is not possible in France to prosecute or execute someone for changing their religion, as it goes against French law, they cannot formally renounce this aspect of Islamic law.

Some people argue that for Islam to adapt to Western Europe, it is necessary to have a general conference with Muslim leaders and scholars to discuss which aspects of Islamic law can remain unchanged and which need to be revised or reinterpreted through different analyses.

For example, a similar approach was taken in Catholicism with what is known as Vatican II, or the Second Vatican Council. This council, held in 1962, was a significant gathering organized by the Pope in Rome, and it lasted four years. During this time, the conference, which the Pope referred to as an *aggiornamento* (an Italian word meaning "bringing up to date" or modernization), aimed to modernize various aspects of the Catholic faith. As a result of this council, there were several changes in Catholic practice. One notable change was the shift in the Church's stance toward Jews. Traditionally, there had been a long-standing belief that Jews were responsible for the death of Christ, a belief that dated back to antiquity. However, during Vatican II, the Pope officially declared that Jews were no longer to be considered responsible for Christ's death. This marked a significant modernization, as it reversed nearly two thousand years of Church doctrine. Many other updates and reforms were also introduced into the Church at this time.

> **Vatican II**, also known as the **Second Vatican Council**, was an ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church, held from 1962 to 1965. Convened by Pope John XXIII and continued under Pope Paul VI, it was one of the most significant events in modern Church history, aimed at addressing relations between the Catholic Church and the modern world.
>
> Key Objectives and Outcomes:
>
> 1. **Modernization of the Church**:
>    - Vatican II sought to modernize the Church, making it more accessible and relevant to contemporary society. This included reforms in liturgy, such as allowing Mass to be celebrated in vernacular languages instead of Latin, making it more understandable and engaging for the laity.
>
> 2. **Ecumenism**:
>    - The council promoted greater unity among Christian denominations and improved relations with other religions. It emphasized dialogue and cooperation, acknowledging the validity of other Christian communities and showing respect for non-Christian religions.
>
> 3. **Reform of Church Practices**:
>    - Vatican II introduced significant changes in how the Church approached issues like religious freedom, the role of the laity, and the Church’s relationship with the secular world. The council documents, such as *Lumen Gentium* and *Gaudium et Spes*, laid out new directions in these areas.
>
> 4. **Renewed Emphasis on Scripture and Tradition**:
>    - The council encouraged a deeper engagement with the Bible and Church traditions, promoting the idea that both Scripture and Tradition are essential to the faith.
>
> 5. **Pastoral Orientation**:
>    - The council emphasized a pastoral approach to ministry, focusing on the needs of the faithful and the importance of engaging with the broader world.
>
> Vatican II was a transformative moment in the Catholic Church, leading to widespread changes in its liturgy, governance, and relationship with the world, significantly shaping modern Catholicism.

A similar process has occurred within Protestant churches. Many Protestant denominations have held meetings to assess societal changes and determine whether adjustments to church doctrine or beliefs were necessary on various issues. For example, for centuries, both Catholic and Protestant churches viewed abortion as a crime. However, in most Protestant churches today, there is a recognition of a woman's individual freedom to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term, including the right to an abortion. This represents a significant evolution, as for many years, abortion was strictly condemned by these churches and often led to excommunication. The same shift can be observed regarding attitudes toward homosexuality. Historically, Christian churches condemned homosexuality, citing verses in the Bible that oppose it. However, many Protestant churches have now issued statements through councils of bishops or other leaders, acknowledging that homosexuality is not a sin, is not against divine law, and have begun to accept and integrate homosexual individuals into the church. This includes the acceptance of same-sex marriages, which was previously unthinkable. Even the Catholic Church has shown signs of evolution on this issue. About six months ago, the Pope made a statement that, while the Catholic Church does not permit the official celebration of same-sex marriages, it does allow for a form of blessing for same-sex couples. This represents a step toward modernization.

What is often discussed regarding Islam is the idea that, like other major religions, Islamic practice can evolve in response to the changing world. Some Islamic scholars support the idea that certain aspects of the religion can undergo modernization and adaptation. For example, within the corpus of Islamic teachings, there are elements that are considered immutable, such as the belief that Muhammad is the Prophet and that there is only one God, Allah. These core beliefs form the foundation of the faith and cannot be altered. However, some scholars argue that other aspects, particularly certain Hadiths (sayings and actions of the Prophet), were written many centuries ago in a specific cultural and historical context that no longer exists. Therefore, they suggest that some evolution is possible in these areas. It’s important to remember that Hadiths are interpretations, and as such, there is room for re-interpretation by contemporary scholars who are recognized as highly knowledgeable. This re-interpretation might not necessarily contradict the original teachings but could represent an evolution, reflecting the differences between the world today and the world centuries ago. A portion of scholars in the Islamic community accept this perspective.

When talking about laïcité and the issue of women wearing the veil, there are three different interpretations on this matter, made by three different scholars in three different countries. The same principle could apply to the issue of blasphemy. Forty years ago, the French Minister of the Interior sought to ask representatives of Muslim countries to simply acknowledge the right of individuals to change their religion. Within the religion itself, it would still be possible to reject this practice. For instance, if someone decides to leave their religion, they could be formally excluded from the religious community. This could mean that the person would no longer receive any blessings, be able to seek help from the community, or be welcome in religious gatherings, family meetings, or community events. The idea is that while the state might recognize the right to change one's religion, the religious community could choose to disassociate from the individual who exercises that right.

For instance, consider the situation of someone who decides to change their religion. This issue has two aspects. First, there is the public aspect, meaning the impact on the national scene. In non-Muslim countries, individuals have the right to change their religion; they are free to do so, whether it means converting to another religion or choosing to have no religion at all. This decision cannot affect their public life.

On the other hand, changing one’s religion can have private consequences, depending on how the religious organization chooses to respond. For example, it could be considered acceptable for Muslim organizations to acknowledge that, in France or any other Western country, there is a principle of freedom to change one’s religion. This would mean that they do not object to this practice outside of their own countries. Thus, in traditional Muslim countries, the prohibition of changing one’s religion could still be enforced, as this restriction would apply outside of, for example, French territory. For example, religious leaders may instruct the faithful to no longer welcome anyone who has decided to leave the religion, practice another faith, or commit apostasy. In this case, it becomes a matter of social interaction rather than a legal or civil rights issue; it is a matter of private life. Scholars might say that while civil law grants individuals the right to change their religion, within the religious community, this is not acceptable. This means that if someone severs their ties with the religion, they also sever their ties with the community. Consequently, they may not be welcomed by their family or friends, even if they are close relatives.

This situation exists in some other religious groups as well. There was a documentary that aired about a year or two ago, which focused on a religious and family group living in Paris. This group has been in Paris for about 200 years, originating around the time of the French Revolution or the era of the Empire. It consists of two or three families who decided to cut off ties with the outside world. They marry within the group, live within the group, and have developed a special system of solidarity among themselves. What is remarkable is that they have managed to maintain this insular community in the heart of a large city like Paris for two centuries. Today, there are about two or three thousand people living in the same area in Paris, interacting only with each other. The documentary highlighted that one of the main rules of the group is that if you leave, it’s final. If you choose to leave, you can never return to the group, and families are prohibited from seeing relatives who have left. From the perspective of civil law, this practice is neither fair nor legal, as individual freedom includes the right to be with your family, to leave, and to choose whom you want to see. However, within this community, such rules are considered the norm. If you are part of the group, you must follow its rules; if you choose not to, you must leave, and once you’re out, there’s no coming back. We can draw an analogy with the concept of apostasy. One could imagine a scenario where apostasy is accepted under public law, but within the religious community, there is a self-organized system where those who do not follow the rules are no longer considered members of the group.

This is exactly what happened in the Christian churches, particularly regarding homosexuality. For decades, individuals who were homosexual were not allowed to fully participate in certain practices within the church. While some participation was possible, not all aspects of religious life were accessible to them. For example, there was no recognition of religious weddings between two people of the same sex. However, in many Protestant churches today, such weddings are now possible, demonstrating that evolution within religious practices can occur.

Another aspect of religious criminal law in Islam concerns blasphemy. Blasphemy, in general—not only in Islam but in the broader sense—refers to any act of questioning or challenging sacred texts or holy concepts. In essence, blasphemy involves using freedom of speech to contest or criticize what is considered sacred by believers, including holy books, religious dogma, or fundamental principles of faith.

In Western liberal countries, blasphemy is not treated as a criminal offense. This is because, in these societies, religion is primarily considered a private matter, and acts of blasphemy do not have legal consequences in public life. State justice systems are not involved in prosecuting blasphemy. To be clear, blasphemy is not included in the criminal code of these countries, as it falls under the protection of freedom of speech.

An example of this issue of blasphemy is seen in the controversy surrounding the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. There was an incident that took place in Denmark about 20 years ago when a newspaper published drawings depicting the Prophet Muhammad. In Islam, it is forbidden to create representations of the human body, face, or animals because it is considered blasphemous to depict what God has created. This is why, in Islamic art, especially in the Arab tradition, you often see geometric patterns and symbols rather than representations of people, animals, or natural forms. However, there is an exception in Persian art, where it is more common to see such depictions, including human figures and animals, due to the influence of Persian cultural traditions.

The controversy in Denmark arose because Denmark is not a Muslim country, and it upholds the principle of freedom of speech, which includes the freedom of artistic expression. When the caricatures were published, the newspaper’s editor, journalists, and the artist who created the drawings received threats, including fatwas calling for their deaths. This sparked a debate in Denmark, a very liberal and open society, about where the line should be drawn between respecting the principles of a liberal society—such as freedom of speech and artistic expression—and respecting the beliefs of minorities, in this case, the Muslim minority. The central question was whether the freedom of speech should be limited out of respect for Islamic prohibitions against depicting the Prophet, or whether the freedom of speech should remain a fundamental principle of Danish society, with the expectation that minorities must accept that religion is considered a matter of private life, not public life, in Western countries. The argument was that while private believers might be offended by such a depiction, they have the right to express their discontent by refusing to purchase the newspaper, calling for a boycott, or expressing their views, but they cannot demand legal penalties against the newspaper, its editor, or its journalists.
