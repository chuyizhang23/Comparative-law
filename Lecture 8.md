## The sources of Chinese law system (continue)

### The notion of law in Chinese law system

In the Chinese legal system, the term "law" has two distinct meanings. The first, narrower meaning refers to law as a written legal text—a legal document that has been voted by the parliament and then enforced within the legal system by the government. The second, broader meaning of the term encompasses any legal norm or principle adopted and approved by various national institutions or the government to define rights and obligations. In essence, the narrower definition refers specifically to legislative texts, while the broader definition considers law as any expression of governmental will that establishes rights and obligations.

In the Chinese legal system, there are different types of norms with a clear hierarchy. At the top is the Constitution. Below the Constitution are the laws, which are acts passed by the parliament. Following these are national executive orders, which are issued by national institutions, including the national government. Next in the hierarchy are local executive orders, which are primarily issued by local governments and local police. These also include orders related to recognized minorities in China, some of which have special status. These minorities may have special legislative bodies that can enact specific laws tailored to their unique needs. Below the executive orders are the national administrative norms, which are established by national administrative bodies. Similarly, there are local administrative norms, which are set by local administrative authorities.

> The hierarchy of legal sources in the Chinese legal system is structured to reflect the different levels of authority and importance of legal documents. This hierarchy is crucial in understanding how laws are applied and interpreted in China. Here’s an overview of the hierarchy:
>
> 1. **The Constitution**
>    - **Highest Authority**: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China is the supreme law of the country. All other laws, regulations, and legal documents must conform to the Constitution. It sets out the fundamental principles of the state, the structure of the government, and the rights and duties of citizens.
>
> 2. **National Laws**
>    - **Laws Passed by the National People’s Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee**: The NPC, which is the highest legislative body in China, enacts laws on important national matters. The Standing Committee of the NPC, which meets more frequently, also passes laws within its delegated authority.
>    - **Examples**: Criminal Law, Civil Code, and the National Security Law.
>
> 3. **Administrative Regulations**
>    - **Issued by the State Council**: The State Council, which is the highest executive organ of state power, issues administrative regulations to implement national laws. These regulations have nationwide applicability and must be consistent with higher laws.
>    - **Examples**: Environmental protection regulations, customs regulations.
>
> 4. **Local Laws and Regulations**
>    - **Issued by Provincial and Local People’s Congresses**: These laws and regulations apply within specific provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities directly under the central government. They must align with the Constitution, national laws, and administrative regulations.
>    - **Examples**: Local economic regulations, urban planning rules.
>
> 5. **Judicial Interpretations**
>    - **Issued by the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate**: These interpretations provide guidance on how laws should be applied in courts. While not laws themselves, judicial interpretations are binding and play a crucial role in legal practice.
>    - **Examples**: Interpretations on the application of specific provisions of the Civil Code or Criminal Law.
>
> 6. **Ministerial Rules and Regulations**
>    - **Issued by Ministries and Commissions under the State Council**: These are more specific rules and guidelines issued by individual ministries to regulate their respective sectors. They must be consistent with national laws and administrative regulations.
>    - **Examples**: Banking regulations by the People’s Bank of China, educational rules by the Ministry of Education.
>
> 7. **Autonomous Region Regulations**
>    - **Issued by Autonomous Regions**: These regions have the authority to enact regulations tailored to their unique cultural and social needs, as long as these do not contradict the Constitution and national laws.
>    - **Examples**: Regulations on the use of local languages or protection of ethnic minority rights.
>
> This hierarchy ensures that laws and regulations are systematically organized, with higher-level laws taking precedence over lower-level regulations. The Chinese legal system emphasizes the importance of the Constitution as the supreme legal authority, ensuring that all other laws and regulations are consistent with it.

In essence, administrative norms are typically national or local executive applications of the law for various specific subjects. The difference between an executive order and an administrative norm lies in their scope and significance. Executive orders are higher in the hierarchy and generally address more important, broad-ranging subjects. In contrast, administrative norms deal with more specific, narrower topics. For example, administrative norms might cover details related to urban planning, building regulations, housing construction, and similar matters. These are more focused and technical, whereas executive orders would pertain to broader policy issues and higher-level governmental decisions.

For the past 24 years, the Constitution has defined the topics that fall under the jurisdiction of legislative law, meaning those subjects governed by laws passed by the national parliament. The Constitution provides a list of these topics, specifying which matters are to be regulated by law rather than by executive orders.

For example, all matters related to elections, including the rules governing elections, must be regulated by law, not by executive orders. Similarly, all issues of sovereignty—whether political, international, energy, or financial sovereignty—are also under the authority of the parliament. Matters of justice, including the organization of the judicial system, are exclusively the responsibility of the parliament rather than the executive branch. This is significant because the parliament represents the people, making it more democratic for it to handle issues related to justice.

Furthermore, criminal law and penalties, property laws, civil law, arbitration, and the organization of trials all fall within the parliament's jurisdiction. The same applies to rules governing public and private finances, commercial law, and customs duties, which are set by the parliament. The protection of individual liberties and public freedoms is also guaranteed by laws passed by the parliament. Additionally, the powers, institutions, and organizations within the country are defined and enforced by laws enacted by the parliament. Lastly, the parliament is responsible for determining and organizing what are known as "specific economic rules." For instance, regions like Hong Kong or Shanghai, which have special economic statuses, fall under the purview of the parliament. This is logical because such special economic zones involve specific regulations concerning commercial law, civil law, and organizational structures, which are all within the parliament's authority.

### The interpretation of law

In China, there are two types of legal interpretation. The first is the interpretation of the law by the parliament. Within the Chinese National Parliament, there exists a structure known as the Standing Committee. This Standing Committee is composed of various members, including the president, vice presidents of the parliament, and some representatives. The committee is responsible for interpreting the law. To date, there have been around 25 instances where this committee has provided interpretations of legislation. After the parliament has passed a law, if there is a need for clarification, further explanation, or precision, this committee is tasked with providing the necessary interpretation. The committee represents the different groups within the parliament, so the interpretation is effectively carried out by the parliament itself, through this Standing Committee.

> As of now, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPCSC) in China has issued a total of 28 formal legislative interpretations since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. These interpretations play a crucial role in clarifying the meaning and application of statutory provisions, ensuring consistent legal understanding and application across the country. The interpretations cover a range of laws, including those related to the Criminal Law and other significant legal statutes.

The second type of interpretation is judicial interpretation, which is carried out by the judiciary. In this context, there have been 116 interpretations made by the judicial system, specifically by the People's Supreme Court, not the parliamentary system.

A key concept in this process is the notion of "exemplary judgments." An exemplary judgment refers to a selection of judgments that the higher court, such as the People's Supreme Court, considers to be of significant importance. These judgments are highlighted as key solutions to important legal questions. When a lower court encounters a case similar to one of these exemplary judgments, the judge is expected to follow the precedent set by the Supreme Court in these exemplary rulings. In essence, this is a selection of decisions that lower courts are encouraged to apply, ensuring consistency and adherence to the legal interpretations provided by the highest court.

### The organization of legal professions

#### Judges

Regarding the legal professions, it's essential to provide a brief historical overview. When the Communist Party came to power in China, they initially decided to abolish the existing judicial systems that had been in place before the rise of communism. The old legal organization was dismantled, and simultaneously, the Communist Party aimed to develop a Marxist judicial system. This approach was similar to what occurred in Russia, the USSR, and other communist countries in Europe and beyond.

In Marxist theory, there is a belief that the separation of powers, a fundamental principle in liberal democracies, is unnecessary in a communist society. Karl Marx, along with Lenin, Stalin, and other key figures in communist theory, argued that the separation of powers in Western countries was an illusion, merely a tool used to disguise the domination of the working class by the bourgeoisie and economic elites. In their view, the true emancipation of the working class required a period of what they called the "dictatorship of the proletariat"—a form of governance where the working class would exert control over the entire society. Under this framework, all power was to be concentrated within the Communist Party, which was considered the primary representative of the people.

For example, the Chinese Constitution still reflects this principle today, as one of its first articles states that all power belongs to the people. This indicates a concept of unity among the people, particularly through the working class. The idea of unity suggests that there is no room for separation, as unity and separation are fundamentally different concepts. Since the Constitution claims that power in the People's Republic belongs to the unity of the people, it implies a rejection of the separation of powers as seen in Western liberal democracies, where power is divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. In contrast, the communist framework—similar to that in the former USSR, Poland before its return to democracy, East Germany, Vietnam, and other socialist states—asserts that all power is concentrated in the hands of the people. This is a key point in understanding the structure of governance under this system.

The second point is that, in communist countries, there was a fundamental belief that the Communist Party serves as both the leader and the representative of the people. As a result, for many decades in various communist nations, the Communist Party was the only political party permitted to exist. It was considered the vanguard of the working class and the sole legitimate leader of the people.

This conception had significant implications for the organization of the legal professions in communist countries. Because the communist system rejects the separation of powers, there is no recognition of an independent judiciary. Without an independent judicial power, the magistrates responsible for administering justice—despite the existence of trials concerning various areas such as family law, labor law, contract law, and criminal law—are not considered an independent body with guaranteed autonomy. Instead, these magistrates function as public officials or civil servants without specific protections for their independence. Additionally, it often meant that judges were members of the Communist Party, holding dual roles as both judges and party officials at certain levels of leadership within the Party structure.

For approximately the past 15 years, China has been developing a more independent judicial system compared to previous decades. This development means that, today, China has professional judges who hold a specific status and are provided with certain guarantees of independence.

In the organization of the judicial system within tribunals, there are three distinct levels. The highest level consists of those referred to as magistrates, who are professional judges. Below them, there is a second level, often termed judicial auxiliaries. These individuals can be likened to clerks in the Supreme Court, as they are responsible for various administrative tasks and the preparation of tribunal sessions. Finally, there are administrative assistants who support the magistrates by assisting with documentation, conducting research, and drafting judgments.

#### barristers

Another important aspect of the legal professions in China involves the role of barristers, advocates, or solicitors—those who represent clients in court. The historical evolution of this profession in communist countries, including China, has been marked by significant challenges. In communist regimes, the status of barristers was generally low. While there were advocates for cases like family disputes, such as divorce or child custody, the overall role of barristers was constrained by the political system. In a communist system, it was not possible for individuals to bring cases against the state or government administration, as citizens were required to adhere to the established social processes without the ability to contest them. This restriction made pursuing a career as a barrister difficult. As a result, many barristers functioned more as legal counselors rather than as advocates in the sense seen in Western liberal countries. Given the extensive power of the state and the Communist Party’s control over society, it was nearly impossible for barristers to challenge the state in court.

During the Stalinist era in the USSR, for example, many trials were held against those who opposed the government, but barristers were often unable to effectively defend their clients, as they were not permitted to argue against the state. Their role was limited to pleading for leniency, acknowledging the client's mistakes, and appealing for reintegration into society, but these were not fair trials by Western standards.

In Communist China, the barrister profession existed but was heavily controlled. Even when barristers were allowed to assist clients, their ability to perform their duties was severely restricted by state oversight. Additionally, for many decades, the barrister profession was not highly regarded socially in China. It was seen as a less desirable career, resulting in a small number of practicing barristers and significant challenges in the exercise of their profession.

The final observation about barristers in China concerns the distinction between two categories within the legal profession. The first category consists of what we might call classical barristers—those in private practice. These barristers, similar to their counterparts around the world, work for private interests, typically representing individuals or companies in legal matters. However, in China, there is also a second category known as public barristers.

Public barristers are public servants who work for the state, employed within various ministries or local administrations. After passing the necessary bar examination, they earn the title of barrister while continuing to serve as public employees. Their role involves representing the administration in legal matters. This structure is somewhat analogous to the situation in some Anglo-Saxon countries, such as the United States, where many individuals pass the bar and become barristers but work in the public sector rather than in private practice. In the U.S., for example, legal advisors for ministers, governors, or senators often hold the title of barrister, even though they work for the government or public organizations.

In China, the situation is similar: some barristers work for private entities, such as corporations or individuals, handling cases related to family law, criminal law, and so on. Meanwhile, others, having started as public servants, continue to work for public administration with the title of barrister, which serves as a certification of their legal expertise and professional status.

#### Notaries

The third category within the legal profession in China is that of public notaries. The primary role of public notaries is to certify various types of legal documents. For example, if two parties have a private contract and wish to give it official legal status, they can request certification from a public notary. This certification might confirm the date of the document or verify the signatures involved. The main function of public notaries is to provide such certifications and to formalize a wide range of documents.

In addition to certification, public notaries are responsible for drafting and registering various legal documents, such as deeds, grants, and other official records. In this regard, they perform functions similar to those of a registrar’s office in the United States. A registrar’s office handles certifications and the recording of important legal documents, a role that exists both in the U.S. and in English-speaking parts of Canada. In Quebec, however, the notarial system follows the French model, where notaries handle such tasks.

Public notaries in China also have the authority to issue official stamps, making their signatures legally binding and giving them the power to authenticate and certify legal acts.

During the communist period, the role of public notaries was quite limited, as nearly everything was controlled by the state and administration. As a result, there was little demand for notarial services, and public notaries were primarily used for family matters, such as marriages and similar events. However, with the liberalization of the economy, the importance of public notaries increased significantly, and today there are approximately 13,000 public notaries practicing in China.

One of the main challenges that has emerged is the overlap between the responsibilities of public notaries and barristers. In certain areas, individuals may seek the services of either a public notary or a barrister, leading to competition between the two professions. For example, if someone needs an official certification, they would typically go to a public notary. However, for tasks such as contract drafting or seeking legal advice, people may hesitate between consulting a notary or a barrister, creating a competitive dynamic between the two roles.

## Public institutions in China

### General presentation

In China, there are numerous territorial divisions, resulting in a hierarchical, pyramid-like administrative system. This structure encompasses various governmental bodies ranging from national to municipal levels, each with its own institutions and specific competencies associated with these different subdivisions.

#### Provinces and Taiwan

In China, there are officially 23 provinces, including Taiwan. There is a longstanding controversy regarding Taiwan's status. Historically known as Formosa, Taiwan was a province of China during both the imperial era and the early republic. At the end of the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Party emerged victorious over the Nationalists. The Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, retreated across the Taiwan Strait to Taiwan, which was the last province not under Communist control.

Since then, two separate governments have existed: the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland, governed by the Communist Party, and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, led by the Nationalists. Initially, the PRC was not widely recognized internationally, except by the Soviet Union and other communist countries. Western nations largely refused to recognize the Communist government, continuing to acknowledge the ROC as the legitimate government of China, because they considered that the communists kept the power by war and not through democratic elections. As a result, China was represented in the United Nations by Taiwan, and the PRC was excluded from international organizations.

During the 1970s, however, many Western governments shifted their stance, recognizing the PRC as the legitimate representative of China, partly due to the PRC's growing economic significance and potential for trade. In 1971, the United Nations transferred China's seat from the ROC to the PRC. Since that time, the PRC has represented China in international affairs, and Taiwan's international recognition has diminished.

The status of Taiwan remains a contentious issue. The PRC considers Taiwan to be a part of its sovereign territory and aims for reunification. On the other hand, many people in Taiwan prefer to maintain their current status, with some advocating for formal independence. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have expressed support for Taiwan, including through naval presence in the region, contributing to tensions between the PRC and Taiwan. Military exercises by both sides serve as demonstrations of their respective positions.

It is noteworthy that, according to the PRC's constitution, Taiwan is included among its 23 provinces, even though Taiwan operates as a separate political entity with its own government. Taiwan's international status is unique; it is recognized by a small number of countries and lacks representation in most international organizations due to the shift in diplomatic recognition to the PRC. Nonetheless, the inclusion of Taiwan as a province in the PRC's administrative divisions reflects the PRC's stance on the issue.

#### Special administrative zones

Following the provinces, China has two Special Administrative Regions (SARs): Hong Kong and Macau. Both regions were former colonies—Hong Kong was a British colony, and Macau was a Portuguese colony. During the 19th century, treaties were established between these countries and China, allowing the foreign powers to control these territories. This situation is somewhat analogous to the status of Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where the Cuban government granted the United States a perpetual lease, resulting in a U.S. naval base on Cuban soil. Guantanamo remains part of Cuba, but the Cuban government has relinquished its sovereignty over that area to the United States.

Similarly, the Chinese government acknowledged that, although Hong Kong and Macau remained part of China's national territory, they had a special status granting sovereignty rights to Britain and Portugal, respectively. It is important to note that during the 19th century, the treaties signed between China and various Western countries, including Japan, were known as "unequal treaties." These treaties were so named because they were not the result of fair negotiations; rather, the weakened Chinese government was compelled by Western powers to cede control over certain territories that were strategically valuable for international trade at the time.

Around the turn of the 21st century—specifically, Hong Kong in 1997 and Macau in 1999—these two territories were returned to the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. Upon their return, both regions were granted special statuses. The reason for this was that during the colonial period, Hong Kong and Macau had developed very liberal economic systems and experienced rapid economic growth. The Chinese government wished to preserve this exceptional economic vitality and therefore decided to apply specific administrative arrangements.

As a result, we have two Special Administrative Regions: Hong Kong and Macau. Each region has its own special status, which mainly pertains to commercial and business law, including the establishment of new companies and international commercial relationships. While both regions are now under the control of the central government of the People's Republic of China.

#### Municipalities with specific organizations

Furthermore, China has four municipalities with specific administrative organizations: Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing. These municipalities do not operate with the same level of local autonomy as other regions; instead, they are directly administered by the central government. While local political authorities exist, these municipalities are considered so essential and populous that they require direct oversight by the state.

#### Autonomous regions

Additionally, China has five autonomous regions designated for certain ethnic minorities: the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. These regions are areas where significant populations of ethnic minorities reside and have specific institutional arrangements granting them a degree of autonomy from the central government. This autonomy allows for the implementation of policies and regulations tailored to the unique cultural, social, and economic needs of these minorities, such as in areas like language, education, and tourism. Within these various administrative divisions—including provinces, special administrative regions, municipalities, and autonomous regions—there are further subdivisions. These include prefectures, counties, and districts, which help manage local governance more effectively.

One of the characteristics of the Chinese institutional system is its extensive administrative subdivision and complex organizational structure. There is a clear hierarchy of institutions, resulting in a hierarchy of local authorities. When a decision needs to be made, the process can be quite lengthy because it starts at a lower level and progresses up through the hierarchy to the top of this administrative pyramid. This system often leads to prolonged decision-making processes.

### Political institutions

#### The communist party

You may be surprised to learn that political institutions are not the only significant entities in China's governance. For the first time, among public institutions, we must study the specific role of the Communist Party. This characteristic is common to communist countries in general. As previously discussed, one of the main principles of communist theory is that to create an ideal communist society succeeding the capitalist one, a period of dictatorship is necessary—the dictatorship of the proletariat (working class). To implement this dictatorship, Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and others considered it essential to assert the uniqueness and necessity of the Communist Party. This meant that, within the theoretical framework of communism, freedom of opinion and expression were not permissible, and the existence of multiple political parties was unacceptable. Consequently, in all communist countries, the principle was established that only one party could exist—the Communist Party—since it represented the working class. Other political parties were either dissolved or prohibited. For example, during elections, there was often only one candidate—the candidate of the Communist Party—with no opposition. Occasionally, there might be multiple candidates, but all from the Communist Party. During the period of the USSR, in each electoral district, elections for deputies or members of parliament typically featured only one candidate, who was a member of the Communist Party.

Another characteristic of the Communist Party, which still exists to some extent in China, is the alignment between each level of public administration and the corresponding level within the Party's internal hierarchy. This means that individuals often held dual roles: one as a public servant—for example, as an academic director within a geographical area—and simultaneously holding an equivalent position within the Communist Party. Consequently, the same person would be both a director in the public administration and a corresponding official within the Party's organizational structure. As a result, the Communist Party was not only the sole political party but also deeply intertwined with the state apparatus. Many public servants were also members of the Party hierarchy, which meant that political liberalism was absent. All instruments of power were concentrated in the hands of Party representatives, eliminating the possibility of political pluralism.

Additionally, there were variations in how strictly the principle of a single Communist Party was applied among different communist countries. In some countries, such as the USSR, Albania, and Romania, the Communist Party was the only legal political party, and the existence of any other parties was prohibited. In contrast, other communist countries, like East Germany, had a slightly different organization. For example, in East Germany, the constitution recognized the leading role of the Communist Party as the representative of the working class. However, alongside the Communist Party, there existed a political organization called the National Front.

Within this National Front, four pre-communist political parties were included as member parties. These parties signed a charter acknowledging the leading role of the Communist Party. They were tolerated as "brother parties" and were required to recognize the supremacy of the Communist Party and share power with it. For instance, in elections, the allocation of parliamentary seats was predetermined: if there were 100 seats, 90 would be allocated to the Communist Party, meaning only Communist Party candidates would fill those seats. The remaining 10 seats were given to these brother parties, each presenting its own candidate in specific constituencies. These candidates represented their respective parties while accepting the leadership of the Communist Party.

In East Germany, among the parties permitted by the Communist Party, there was, for example, the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany. Before the Second World War and the Nazi dictatorship, Germany had liberal parties that defended liberal economic and social principles. These liberal parties were banned by the Nazis. After the war, when Nazism was defeated, the old parties were reestablished. In West Germany, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) was founded; it had representatives and ministers within the liberal democratic political institutions. However, in East Germany, when the Liberal Democratic Party was reestablished, it soon came under the control of the Communist Party. Throughout the decades of the German Democratic Republic, this Liberal Democratic Party existed only because it was a partner of the Communist Party. In reality, this party had no autonomy regarding its political beliefs, objectives, or program. It was merely an element within the communist organization through the National Front. Similarly, the Social Democratic Party was one of the main parties in West Germany and remains so today. However, in East Germany, the Social Democratic Party was effectively absorbed into the Communist Party. There were also two other parties that existed before the war and were reestablished at the time of the creation of the German Democratic Republic.

China has a similar system where the Communist Party plays a central role. The Communist Party is considered the pioneering institution leading the working class and is responsible for guiding the development of socialism in the country. With a population of approximately 1.4 billion inhabitants, the CPC has around 95 million members.

As previously mentioned, there is a hierarchical structure within both the state administration and the Communist Party. At every level of government—from small municipalities to the National People's Congress—public servants and elected representatives hold positions that correspond to roles within the Communist Party's hierarchy. This creates a close connection between the administrative and political levels within the Party, resulting in a dual administration: one by the state through public servants, and one by the Communist Party through its representatives.

In addition to the Communist Party, China also has eight other political parties, referred to as democratic parties. Some of these parties existed during the time of the Republic, before the Communist rise to power in 1949. These eight parties function similarly to the so-called "brother parties" in East Germany, as mentioned earlier. They acknowledge the leading role of the Communist Party and accept the distribution of certain elected positions in coordination with it.

> In addition to the Communist Party of China (CPC), there are **eight other legally recognized political parties** in China. These parties participate in a system known as "multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC." While they are not opposition parties in the Western sense, they play a consultative role in governance. Here are the eight parties:
>
> 1. **Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK)**  
   *Founded in 1948, the RCCK consists mainly of former members of the Kuomintang (KMT) who remained on the mainland after the Chinese Civil War. It focuses on promoting national reunification and socialist modernization.*
>
> 2. **China Democratic League (CDL)**  
   *Established in 1941, the CDL is composed primarily of intellectuals and academics in the fields of culture, education, and science. It aims to promote democratic principles and social development.*
>
> 3. **China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA)**  
>    *Founded in 1945, the CDNCA's membership includes entrepreneurs and professionals in economics and business. The party contributes to economic policy and development strategies.*
>
> 4. **China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD)**  
>    *Established in 1945, the CAPD is made up mainly of educators, writers, and workers in the cultural sector. It focuses on educational reform and cultural advancement.*
>
> 5. **Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP)**  
>    *Founded in 1930, the CPWDP includes professionals in healthcare, science, and technology. The party emphasizes rural development and public health initiatives.*
>
> 6. **China Zhi Gong Party (CZGP)**  
>    *Established in 1925, the CZGP consists largely of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives. It works to promote the interests of the Chinese diaspora and national unity.*
>
> 7. **Jiusan Society**  
>    *Founded in 1945, the Jiusan Society's members are predominantly scientists and engineers. The party is dedicated to promoting science, technology, and socialist democracy.*
>
> 8. **Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSL)**  
>    *Established in 1947, the TDSL is composed of Taiwanese living on the mainland. The party advocates for peaceful reunification with Taiwan and represents the interests of Taiwanese compatriots.*
>
> These parties participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and have representation in the National People's Congress (NPC). They collaborate with the CPC to contribute to policymaking and national development but do not function as opposition parties.

This arrangement means that the vast majority of seats in the National People's Congress, as well as in local provincial and municipal bodies, are held by candidates from the Communist Party. In most cases, candidates run unopposed, so there is no competition. A small number of seats are allocated to members of these eight democratic parties, but they operate under the premise of accepting the Communist Party's pioneering and leadership role. In practice, these parties do not present significantly different or independent political programs. Their policies largely align with those of the Communist Party, with only minor variations in focus.

> In China's National People's Congress (NPC), the majority of deputies are members of the Communist Party of China (CPC). As of the 14th NPC, which convened in March 2023, there are a total of 2,977 deputies. Approximately 74% of these deputies are CPC members, amounting to around 2,202 individuals.

As a result, there is little true political pluralism in this system. The political landscape is heavily concentrated in the hands of the Communist Party, which remains the dominant political organization in the country.

When we compare this with the situation in Western countries—specifically liberal democracies—we observe that their constitutions typically do not mention specific political parties. In many Western nations, constitutions make no reference to political parties at all. This reflects the liberal conception that political parties are formed by the people as they see fit and can dissolve if they lose popular support. The state is not involved in the establishment or regulation of these parties.

For example, in the United States, the Constitution does not mention political parties. In a liberal system, citizens vote for individuals, and if these individuals are members of political parties, those parties exist as a result of free association. However, these parties have no official status within the Constitution. Political liberalism maintains that matters of public freedom and expression are not within the purview of the state to regulate. Such freedoms are inherent and exist independently of state control.

In some liberal countries, particularly in major European nations like France and Germany, the constitution acknowledges the existence of political parties and affirms their role in shaping policies and participating in elections. For example, Article 4 of the French Constitution states that political parties are freely established and may participate in elections and governance. The only limitation for political parties in France is that, to be legal, they must respect the principles enshrined in the Constitution and adhere to public order. This means that one cannot create a political party that seeks to undermine democracy or the Constitution itself.

Similarly, in Germany, there is general freedom to establish political parties, but it is prohibited to form parties that do not respect the constitutional framework and fundamental principles, such as equality and individual liberties protected by the Constitution. However, in these cases, the Constitution does not designate any specific party as the primary or official party, nor does it endorse a party as the leader of the working class or any other singular focus.

In liberal countries, political parties are sometimes not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution because they are considered a matter of individual freedom rather than state control. In other instances, the Constitution provides a general framework regarding the constitutional status of political parties, requiring them to respect constitutional principles and general freedoms, but it does not protect or favor the existence of any particular party.

In contrast to liberal countries, communist nations like China explicitly recognize in their constitutions the specific roles attributed to an official party—the Communist Party—which maintains close ties with the government and administration. The constitution may also acknowledge the existence of other parties that are affiliated with the Communist Party.

Historically, in countries like East Germany and presently in China, these smaller political parties exist solely because the Communist Party permits their existence. In both cases, it is not possible for individuals to independently establish new political parties. China has eight such parties, most of which were established during the Republic before the revolution of 1949. These parties continued to exist because the Communist Party allowed them to, on the condition that they accepted control by and collaboration with the Communist Party. Consequently, it is entirely out of the question for someone to declare an intention to create a new party or for groups to form a party with specific aims, such as advocating for the rule of law, protecting public freedoms, or defending minority rights. This is not permissible. Individuals can only be members of parties that are recognized by the constitution or by law, all under the supervision of the Communist Party.

Thus, in this regard, the organizational structure is entirely different from that which exists in liberal countries. However, this is not unique to China; rather, China is applying the same system that existed in other communist countries, such as the former USSR, East Germany, Poland, and others. Consequently, there is very strict control over freedom of opinion and freedom of speech, enforced through the specific role attributed to the Communist Party.

#### The national parliament

The national parliament is called the **National People's Congress** (NPC), which is the official name. Members of the NPC are elected for five-year terms. The vast majority of representatives are members of the Communist Party, while some are members of one of the eight other parties previously mentioned. In the different provinces, there are equivalents of the National People's Congress known as **local people's congresses**. These bodies are elected under similar conditions and are responsible for the administration of their respective areas, such as provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.

The National People's Congress holds legislative power in China, meaning that all laws are enacted by this body. The NPC also possesses constitutional authority; when it is necessary to amend the Constitution, the NPC undertakes this responsibility. Thus, the National People's Congress serves as both a legislative assembly and a constitutional assembly when constitutional revisions are required. Additionally, the NPC is responsible for appointing the highest state authorities, including the President of the People's Republic of China, the Vice President, the Premier of the State Council, the Vice Premiers, the President of the Supreme People's Court, and the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. However, in practice, these nominations are significantly influenced by the Communist Party of China, which effectively oversees the selection process.

Laws, constitutional reforms, the budget, and the appointment of high-level leaders are all formally voted on by the Parliament, which is elected by the people. However, in reality, the concrete decisions—such as who will be President or Prime Minister—are actually made within the Communist Party. This is because the Party serves as the pioneering and leading force of the working class. Furthermore, there is a corresponding hierarchical structure between the administrative or institutional levels and the levels within the Communist Party. Therefore, there is an appearance and a reality: the appearance is that we have a Parliament elected by the people that votes on legislation and appointments, and this is formally true. But in reality, political choices are made by the highest levels of the Party leadership. This was also the case in all other communist countries.

This phenomenon is not unique to the Chinese system; rather, it is linked to the coexistence in China today of, on one hand, a political and administrative organization that is still inspired by the communist conception of state and administration, and on the other hand, a legal system—particularly in the areas of international trade and economy—that is more economically liberal and connected with the forces of globalization and international competition. This is the main characteristic of China today. From an economic or business perspective, China is a very liberal country, even though there is still some state control. Furthermore, the conception of the economy and the legal instruments employed align with the general movement of globalization. During the period of strict communism, there were no private enterprises; only public entities existed. Nowadays, while state-owned enterprises still exist, there are many private companies that have achieved significant success both domestically and internationally. However, it is also true that China's political and administrative organizations continue to function according to the general concepts of Marxism and communist ideology. This duality is truly the defining characteristic of China.

Within the Parliament exists a body known as the **Standing Committee**. We discussed this Standing Committee before the break. This committee is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and laws, as previously noted. Additionally, it functions similarly to a constitutional council. If there is a question concerning the constitutionality of a law, this committee conducts the review. This method was common in many countries before the Second World War; since then, constitutional courts have become more prevalent. In China, it is the Parliament that exercises control over the constitutionality of laws. This is rare nowadays but was a frequent practice for several decades before the Second World War. Moreover, the Standing Committee also performs oversight functions, such as supervising the judicial administration.

Finally, within the Parliament, there are ten special committees. These committees are groups of representatives responsible for examining specific subjects. For example, there is a Committee on Financial and Economic Affairs, a Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, a Committee on Foreign Affairs, among others. Members of these committees work together to prepare and review legislative proposals before they are debated in the main chamber of the Parliament. These committees also maintain communication with various ministers. For instance, the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee maintains regular contact with the Ministry of Finance. This enables the Minister of Finance and officials from the ministry to communicate with Parliament by providing documents, explaining policy details, engaging in discussions, and promoting legislative developments. Similar interactions occur within all of the committees.
