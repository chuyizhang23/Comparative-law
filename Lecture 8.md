## The sources of Chinese law system (continue)

### The notion of law in Chinese law system

In the Chinese legal system, the term "law" has two distinct meanings. The first, narrower meaning refers to law as a written legal text—a legal document that has been voted by the parliament and then enforced within the legal system by the government. The second, broader meaning of the term encompasses any legal norm or principle adopted and approved by various national institutions or the government to define rights and obligations. In essence, the narrower definition refers specifically to legislative texts, while the broader definition considers law as any expression of governmental will that establishes rights and obligations.

In the Chinese legal system, there are different types of norms with a clear hierarchy. At the top is the Constitution. Below the Constitution are the laws, which are acts passed by the parliament. Following these are national executive orders, which are issued by national institutions, including the national government. Next in the hierarchy are local executive orders, which are primarily issued by local governments and local police. These also include orders related to recognized minorities in China, some of which have special status. These minorities may have special legislative bodies that can enact specific laws tailored to their unique needs. Below the executive orders are the national administrative norms, which are established by national administrative bodies. Similarly, there are local administrative norms, which are set by local administrative authorities.

> The hierarchy of legal sources in the Chinese legal system is structured to reflect the different levels of authority and importance of legal documents. This hierarchy is crucial in understanding how laws are applied and interpreted in China. Here’s an overview of the hierarchy:
>
> 1. **The Constitution**
>    - **Highest Authority**: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China is the supreme law of the country. All other laws, regulations, and legal documents must conform to the Constitution. It sets out the fundamental principles of the state, the structure of the government, and the rights and duties of citizens.
>
> 2. **National Laws**
>    - **Laws Passed by the National People’s Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee**: The NPC, which is the highest legislative body in China, enacts laws on important national matters. The Standing Committee of the NPC, which meets more frequently, also passes laws within its delegated authority.
>    - **Examples**: Criminal Law, Civil Code, and the National Security Law.
>
> 3. **Administrative Regulations**
>    - **Issued by the State Council**: The State Council, which is the highest executive organ of state power, issues administrative regulations to implement national laws. These regulations have nationwide applicability and must be consistent with higher laws.
>    - **Examples**: Environmental protection regulations, customs regulations.
>
> 4. **Local Laws and Regulations**
>    - **Issued by Provincial and Local People’s Congresses**: These laws and regulations apply within specific provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities directly under the central government. They must align with the Constitution, national laws, and administrative regulations.
>    - **Examples**: Local economic regulations, urban planning rules.
>
> 5. **Judicial Interpretations**
>    - **Issued by the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate**: These interpretations provide guidance on how laws should be applied in courts. While not laws themselves, judicial interpretations are binding and play a crucial role in legal practice.
>    - **Examples**: Interpretations on the application of specific provisions of the Civil Code or Criminal Law.
>
> 6. **Ministerial Rules and Regulations**
>    - **Issued by Ministries and Commissions under the State Council**: These are more specific rules and guidelines issued by individual ministries to regulate their respective sectors. They must be consistent with national laws and administrative regulations.
>    - **Examples**: Banking regulations by the People’s Bank of China, educational rules by the Ministry of Education.
>
> 7. **Autonomous Region Regulations**
>    - **Issued by Autonomous Regions**: These regions have the authority to enact regulations tailored to their unique cultural and social needs, as long as these do not contradict the Constitution and national laws.
>    - **Examples**: Regulations on the use of local languages or protection of ethnic minority rights.
>
> This hierarchy ensures that laws and regulations are systematically organized, with higher-level laws taking precedence over lower-level regulations. The Chinese legal system emphasizes the importance of the Constitution as the supreme legal authority, ensuring that all other laws and regulations are consistent with it.

In essence, administrative norms are typically national or local executive applications of the law for various specific subjects. The difference between an executive order and an administrative norm lies in their scope and significance. Executive orders are higher in the hierarchy and generally address more important, broad-ranging subjects. In contrast, administrative norms deal with more specific, narrower topics. For example, administrative norms might cover details related to urban planning, building regulations, housing construction, and similar matters. These are more focused and technical, whereas executive orders would pertain to broader policy issues and higher-level governmental decisions.

For the past 24 years, the Constitution has defined the topics that fall under the jurisdiction of legislative law, meaning those subjects governed by laws passed by the national parliament. The Constitution provides a list of these topics, specifying which matters are to be regulated by law rather than by executive orders.

For example, all matters related to elections, including the rules governing elections, must be regulated by law, not by executive orders. Similarly, all issues of sovereignty—whether political, international, energy, or financial sovereignty—are also under the authority of the parliament. Matters of justice, including the organization of the judicial system, are exclusively the responsibility of the parliament rather than the executive branch. This is significant because the parliament represents the people, making it more democratic for it to handle issues related to justice.

Furthermore, criminal law and penalties, property laws, civil law, arbitration, and the organization of trials all fall within the parliament's jurisdiction. The same applies to rules governing public and private finances, commercial law, and customs duties, which are set by the parliament. The protection of individual liberties and public freedoms is also guaranteed by laws passed by the parliament. Additionally, the powers, institutions, and organizations within the country are defined and enforced by laws enacted by the parliament. Lastly, the parliament is responsible for determining and organizing what are known as "specific economic rules." For instance, regions like Hong Kong or Shanghai, which have special economic statuses, fall under the purview of the parliament. This is logical because such special economic zones involve specific regulations concerning commercial law, civil law, and organizational structures, which are all within the parliament's authority.

### The interpretation of law

In China, there are two types of legal interpretation. The first is the interpretation of the law by the parliament. Within the Chinese National Parliament, there exists a structure known as the Standing Committee. This Standing Committee is composed of various members, including the president, vice presidents of the parliament, and some representatives. The committee is responsible for interpreting the law. To date, there have been around 25 instances where this committee has provided interpretations of legislation. After the parliament has passed a law, if there is a need for clarification, further explanation, or precision, this committee is tasked with providing the necessary interpretation. The committee represents the different groups within the parliament, so the interpretation is effectively carried out by the parliament itself, through this Standing Committee.

> As of now, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPCSC) in China has issued a total of 28 formal legislative interpretations since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. These interpretations play a crucial role in clarifying the meaning and application of statutory provisions, ensuring consistent legal understanding and application across the country. The interpretations cover a range of laws, including those related to the Criminal Law and other significant legal statutes.

The second type of interpretation is judicial interpretation, which is carried out by the judiciary. In this context, there have been 116 interpretations made by the judicial system, specifically by the People's Supreme Court, not the parliamentary system.

A key concept in this process is the notion of "exemplary judgments." An exemplary judgment refers to a selection of judgments that the higher court, such as the People's Supreme Court, considers to be of significant importance. These judgments are highlighted as key solutions to important legal questions. When a lower court encounters a case similar to one of these exemplary judgments, the judge is expected to follow the precedent set by the Supreme Court in these exemplary rulings. In essence, this is a selection of decisions that lower courts are encouraged to apply, ensuring consistency and adherence to the legal interpretations provided by the highest court.

### The organization of legal professions

#### Judges

Regarding the legal professions, it's essential to provide a brief historical overview. When the Communist Party came to power in China, they initially decided to abolish the existing judicial systems that had been in place before the rise of communism. The old legal organization was dismantled, and simultaneously, the Communist Party aimed to develop a Marxist judicial system. This approach was similar to what occurred in Russia, the USSR, and other communist countries in Europe and beyond.

In Marxist theory, there is a belief that the separation of powers, a fundamental principle in liberal democracies, is unnecessary in a communist society. Karl Marx, along with Lenin, Stalin, and other key figures in communist theory, argued that the separation of powers in Western countries was an illusion, merely a tool used to disguise the domination of the working class by the bourgeoisie and economic elites. In their view, the true emancipation of the working class required a period of what they called the "dictatorship of the proletariat"—a form of governance where the working class would exert control over the entire society. Under this framework, all power was to be concentrated within the Communist Party, which was considered the primary representative of the people.

For example, the Chinese Constitution still reflects this principle today, as one of its first articles states that all power belongs to the people. This indicates a concept of unity among the people, particularly through the working class. The idea of unity suggests that there is no room for separation, as unity and separation are fundamentally different concepts. Since the Constitution claims that power in the People's Republic belongs to the unity of the people, it implies a rejection of the separation of powers as seen in Western liberal democracies, where power is divided among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. In contrast, the communist framework—similar to that in the former USSR, Poland before its return to democracy, East Germany, Vietnam, and other socialist states—asserts that all power is concentrated in the hands of the people. This is a key point in understanding the structure of governance under this system.

The second point is that, in communist countries, there was a fundamental belief that the Communist Party serves as both the leader and the representative of the people. As a result, for many decades in various communist nations, the Communist Party was the only political party permitted to exist. It was considered the vanguard of the working class and the sole legitimate leader of the people.

This conception had significant implications for the organization of the legal professions in communist countries. Because the communist system rejects the separation of powers, there is no recognition of an independent judiciary. Without an independent judicial power, the magistrates responsible for administering justice—despite the existence of trials concerning various areas such as family law, labor law, contract law, and criminal law—are not considered an independent body with guaranteed autonomy. Instead, these magistrates function as public officials or civil servants without specific protections for their independence. Additionally, it often meant that judges were members of the Communist Party, holding dual roles as both judges and party officials at certain levels of leadership within the Party structure.

For approximately the past 15 years, China has been developing a more independent judicial system compared to previous decades. This development means that, today, China has professional judges who hold a specific status and are provided with certain guarantees of independence.

In the organization of the judicial system within tribunals, there are three distinct levels. The highest level consists of those referred to as magistrates, who are professional judges. Below them, there is a second level, often termed judicial auxiliaries. These individuals can be likened to clerks in the Supreme Court, as they are responsible for various administrative tasks and the preparation of tribunal sessions. Finally, there are administrative assistants who support the magistrates by assisting with documentation, conducting research, and drafting judgments.

#### barristers

Another important aspect of the legal professions in China involves the role of barristers, advocates, or solicitors—those who represent clients in court. The historical evolution of this profession in communist countries, including China, has been marked by significant challenges. In communist regimes, the status of barristers was generally low. While there were advocates for cases like family disputes, such as divorce or child custody, the overall role of barristers was constrained by the political system. In a communist system, it was not possible for individuals to bring cases against the state or government administration, as citizens were required to adhere to the established social processes without the ability to contest them. This restriction made pursuing a career as a barrister difficult. As a result, many barristers functioned more as legal counselors rather than as advocates in the sense seen in Western liberal countries. Given the extensive power of the state and the Communist Party’s control over society, it was nearly impossible for barristers to challenge the state in court.

During the Stalinist era in the USSR, for example, many trials were held against those who opposed the government, but barristers were often unable to effectively defend their clients, as they were not permitted to argue against the state. Their role was limited to pleading for leniency, acknowledging the client's mistakes, and appealing for reintegration into society, but these were not fair trials by Western standards.

In Communist China, the barrister profession existed but was heavily controlled. Even when barristers were allowed to assist clients, their ability to perform their duties was severely restricted by state oversight. Additionally, for many decades, the barrister profession was not highly regarded socially in China. It was seen as a less desirable career, resulting in a small number of practicing barristers and significant challenges in the exercise of their profession.

The final observation about barristers in China concerns the distinction between two categories within the legal profession. The first category consists of what we might call classical barristers—those in private practice. These barristers, similar to their counterparts around the world, work for private interests, typically representing individuals or companies in legal matters. However, in China, there is also a second category known as public barristers. 

Public barristers are public servants who work for the state, employed within various ministries or local administrations. After passing the necessary bar examination, they earn the title of barrister while continuing to serve as public employees. Their role involves representing the administration in legal matters. This structure is somewhat analogous to the situation in some Anglo-Saxon countries, such as the United States, where many individuals pass the bar and become barristers but work in the public sector rather than in private practice. In the U.S., for example, legal advisors for ministers, governors, or senators often hold the title of barrister, even though they work for the government or public organizations.

In China, the situation is similar: some barristers work for private entities, such as corporations or individuals, handling cases related to family law, criminal law, and so on. Meanwhile, others, having started as public servants, continue to work for public administration with the title of barrister, which serves as a certification of their legal expertise and professional status.
