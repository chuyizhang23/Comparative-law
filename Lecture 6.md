## Different branches of law (continue)

### The notion of "fatwa" (continue)

A fatwa is a clarification of Islamic law by scholars, muftis, or certain judges. The objective of a fatwa is to provide people with an interpretation of traditional rules to address problems related to daily life, particularly private life. Many fatwas pertain specifically to daily activities. For example, there was a fatwa I mentioned earlier about space exploration and the position of astronauts. Numerous fatwas also address various aspects of sexual life, clarifying what is allowed and what is not, in accordance with God's law.

Fatwas can also cover aspects of very daily life, such as relationships between spouses, interactions with children, and family law. They may offer guidance on appropriate behavior with your boss, employees, or clients. Additionally, fatwas can provide instructions on daily religious practices, such as the rights and behaviors during religious ceremonies or prayers. They define what constitutes good or bad behavior during prayer and other daily religious rituals.

> A fatwa is a formal legal opinion or ruling issued by an Islamic scholar, known as a mufti, on matters of Islamic law (Sharia). It is a response to a specific question or issue brought by an individual or a court, addressing a wide range of topics including religious practices, social issues, business dealings, and personal conduct.
>
> Here are key points about a fatwa:
>
> 1. **Authority**: While a fatwa is respected and considered authoritative within the Muslim community, it is not universally binding. Different scholars may issue different fatwas on the same issue, leading to a variety of interpretations and practices within Islam.
>
> 2. **Sources**: Fatwas are based on interpretations of the Quran, Hadith (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad), consensus of scholars (ijma), and analogical reasoning (qiyas). The specific sources and methods can vary among different Islamic traditions and schools of thought.
>
> 3. **Contextual and Advisory**: A fatwa is generally context-specific and addresses the questioner's particular circumstances. It is advisory rather than judicial, meaning it does not have the force of law unless endorsed by a governing authority in countries where Sharia is part of the legal system.
>
> 4. **Variety of Issues**: Fatwas can address almost any issue a Muslim might face, from the minutiae of daily rituals to complex legal matters. Common topics include dietary laws, religious observances, family matters, and ethical dilemmas.
>
> 5. **Public vs. Private**: Some fatwas are issued in response to private queries, while others are made public to address widespread issues or concerns within the community.
>
> 6. **Not Universal**: Different Islamic sects (e.g., Sunni, Shia) and schools of jurisprudence (e.g., Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) may have different processes and guidelines for issuing fatwas, and a fatwa issued by one authority may not be recognized by others.

A fatwa can be considered a norm because it comes from a recognized authority. The issue lies in determining whether the authority who issued the fatwa is deemed sufficiently important. For instance, in the case of Salman Rushdie that we discussed earlier, the fatwa came from Ayatollah Khomeini. This meant that the fatwa was seen as an order or a real norm by those who follow Ayatollah Khomeini and adhere to the Shiite branch of Islam. In Islam, there are two main branches, and for the followers of the Shiite branch, Ayatollah Khomeini was regarded as a very high-level authority. Thus, his interpretation was considered an order or a norm.

> The Sunni and Shiite branches of Islam primarily differ in their beliefs about the rightful successor to Prophet Muhammad, with Sunnis supporting Abu Bakr, chosen through consensus, and Shiites advocating for Ali, the Prophet’s cousin and son-in-law, as divinely appointed. This split, originating in the 7th century, led to distinct religious authorities, with Sunnis following elected caliphs and diverse jurisprudential schools, while Shiites emphasize a line of Imams starting with Ali. Sunnis constitute about 85-90% of Muslims globally, dominating regions like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, whereas Shiites, about 10-15%, are concentrated in Iran and parts of Iraq and Lebanon. Despite both sects sharing core Islamic tenets, they differ in practices such as prayer rituals and the observance of religious events like Ashura, which is particularly significant for Shiites. These differences have influenced the religious, cultural, and political dynamics within the Muslim world.
>
> The conservatism of Shiite and Sunni branches of Islam is not uniformly inherent to either sect but varies significantly based on regional, cultural, and political contexts. For instance, Shiite Islam in Iran is often perceived as highly conservative due to theocratic governance, while in Lebanon, the practices may be more diverse. Similarly, Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation influenced by Wahhabism, contrasting with more moderate practices in Sunni-majority countries like Turkey or Indonesia. Therefore, the degree of conservatism in both branches is influenced by local traditions, political regimes, and cultural factors rather than being a fixed characteristic of Shiism or Sunnism.

However, for other Muslims who belong to different branches or do not follow Shiism, it was merely an interpretation that they did not necessarily follow. When the fatwa was issued, not all Muslims attempted to harm Rushdie. Some did because they were linked to Khomeini and agreed with his interpretation. However, the majority of Muslims did not attempt to prosecute or execute Rushdie because they did not view Khomeini's order as a binding norm. This distinction also depends on whether we are discussing moderate, liberal, or more conservative Muslims.

For example, Khomeini's order was accepted by some people in Afghanistan, even if they were not Shiite, because they favored a very strict and conservative interpretation of Islam and believed Khomeini was right. Conversely, in many countries with a more liberal or moderate approach to Islam, Khomeini's order was not followed. Rushdie, during his conferences, met some Muslims who did not accept Khomeini's decision, viewing it as too strict and conservative. These Muslims were shocked by the idea of the "Satanic Verses" and the expression it represented, but while they disagreed with Rushdie's position, they did not believe he should be killed.

On the other hand, some people felt that being offended justified retaliating against the writer. The main difference lies in the authority of the scholar who issued the interpretation of Sharia and whether what is written in this expression of Sharia is considered a good response. Many Muslims were shocked but did not believe Rushdie should be executed. They thought that if Rushdie were to be punished, it would be by God in the afterlife, not by them. They felt it was not their duty to speak for God. In contrast, some believe they must act as the enforcers of God's law on earth, prosecuting and executing those who do not respect it.

Fatwa is an interpretation of Sharia that some people follow, but not everyone does. And this is why, for example, in the practice of ritual ceremonies, you can observe differences from one country to another. Different countries have scholars who issue fatwas with slightly varying interpretations, leading to these differences. This variation arises from interpreting unclear matters and applying these interpretations to specific cases. For instance, regarding the appropriate reaction when a writer publishes a book deemed offensive to God, one interpretation might be to strongly oppose the book, refuse to read it, and ban its sale, without advocating for the writer's punishment. Consequently, in many Muslim countries, such books are prohibited by the authorities.

There have also been instances where fatwas have been issued regarding movies. For example, the recent Barbie movie was prohibited from being shown in many Muslim countries. In some countries, this ban was enforced by law, as in Algeria. In other countries, the prohibition came from religious authorities issuing fatwas, stating that the movie was offensive to God, disrespectful towards women, and contrary to religious principles concerning the relationship between men and women. Consequently, the film was banned in those territories. However, this was not the case in all Muslim countries; in some, people were free to watch the film. This demonstrates the range of responses: some authorities may simply disapprove of a book or movie, others may ban it from being sold or shown, and still others may seek to prosecute the author, arrest them, jail them, or even call for their execution.

But this is one interpretation at a specific moment for one book or one movie, and it is not necessarily applied uniformly across all countries. The influence of a fatwa depends on the recognition and authority of the issuing scholars, which can vary. Additionally, Muslim countries have different approaches to applying religious rules in civil society. For example, Morocco is relatively liberal, and the movie Barbie was not prohibited; people could watch it in cinemas. This was not the case in Algeria, where the film was banned, either by law or executive order, through official government notification. In other countries, fatwas issued by scholars led to the ban, which might or might not be followed. As we discussed, there are varying degrees of prohibition: in some countries, the movie is outright banned, while in others, it is not prohibited but socially discouraged, leaving individuals free to choose whether to watch it or not.

A fatwa can be considered a kind of norm, but it is not a universal norm that must be applied by everyone. Its influence depends largely on the reputation of the author of the fatwa. There are many kinds of fatwas, and while high-profile cases like Salman Rushdie's receive a lot of media attention, there are numerous fatwas issued on a wide range of subjects in the regular legal life of Muslim countries. Some fatwas have very local applications, specific to a particular country or even a specific town. Conversely, some fatwas are widely applied across many countries. Additionally, there are fatwas that are very old; fatwas have been issued since the time of the Prophet's death centuries ago. Some fatwas from the 19th or 20th century are still referenced by judges or authorities to determine what is permissible or not.

### The notion of Hisbah

Hisbah means the rule of moral rectitude. The idea behind it is to provide the population with guidelines to determine what is permissible and not permissible in public areas. This is the purpose of Hisbah.

> Hisbah is an Islamic concept that refers to the duty of enjoining good and forbidding wrong. Rooted in the Quran and Sunnah, it encompasses the promotion of ethical conduct and the prevention of immoral or harmful behavior within an Islamic society. The term "Hisbah" comes from the Arabic root "hasaba," which means to reckon or to account, implying the act of holding individuals and society accountable to Islamic principles.
>
> Key Aspects of Hisbah:
>
> 1. **Theological Basis:**
>    - Hisbah is based on various Quranic verses and Hadiths that emphasize the importance of promoting virtue and preventing vice. For example, the Quran states, "Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong" (Quran 3:104).
>
> 2. **Role and Functions:**
>    - Traditionally, the role of Hisbah was carried out by a designated official known as the Muhtasib, who was responsible for market regulation, public morals, and ensuring adherence to Islamic law in public life.
>    - The Muhtasib would oversee activities such as ensuring honest trade practices, maintaining public order, preventing cheating in commerce, and upholding moral conduct.
>
> 3. **Modern Implementation:**
>    - In contemporary times, Hisbah functions are often carried out by government or quasi-governmental bodies in some Muslim-majority countries. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice performs similar roles.
>    - The scope and methods of Hisbah enforcement can vary widely, ranging from advisory and educational activities to more coercive measures.
>
> 4. **Controversies and Criticism:**
>    - Hisbah practices, especially when enforced by state authorities, have been subject to criticism and controversy. Issues include the potential for human rights abuses, infringement on personal freedoms, and the imposition of strict interpretations of morality.
>    - Critics argue that the application of Hisbah can sometimes lead to the persecution of individuals for behaviors deemed unacceptable by conservative interpretations of Islamic law.
>
> Conclusion:
>
> Hisbah represents a significant aspect of Islamic governance and social ethics, emphasizing the collective responsibility to uphold moral standards and prevent wrongdoing within the community. However, its implementation and impact can vary greatly depending on the socio-political context and the interpretations of Islamic law in different regions.

In Iran, there is a branch of the police known as the "morality police." This specific branch of the police system operates within cities to observe and ensure that people adhere to the moral duties prescribed by Islamic law in Iran. For instance, when I was lecturing at a university in Iran, the use of elevators was prohibited at one point. This restriction was imposed because the morality police were inspecting the university buildings and determined that men and women could be alone in the elevator, potentially engaging in prohibited behaviors such as kissing, touching, or hugging. To prevent such actions, which are strictly forbidden in public areas, the elevators were closed to everyone. The university had six levels, making it quite inconvenient, but this serves as an example of the influence and actions of the morality police.

> Iran's morality police, officially known as the "Guidance Patrol" (Gasht-e Ershad), is a specialized unit tasked with enforcing Islamic dress codes and social behavior in public spaces. The primary focus of the morality police is to ensure adherence to the Islamic dress code, particularly the requirement for women to wear the hijab (a headscarf covering the hair) and modest clothing that covers the arms and legs. They also monitor other aspects of public behavior, including interactions between men and women, the observance of religious practices, and general moral conduct according to the state's interpretation of Islamic law.
>
> The morality police operate by patrolling public areas, issuing warnings, fines, or detaining individuals who are deemed to be violating the dress code or other moral guidelines. Their actions have been a subject of controversy and criticism, both domestically and internationally, for their perceived infringement on personal freedoms and human rights. Protests and opposition to their activities have been significant, especially from women's rights activists and younger generations who advocate for more personal freedom and less stringent enforcement of dress codes and social behaviors.

Hisbah enforces the obligation of public decency in public areas, not as a suggestion but as a norm that everyone must follow. The administration has a duty to ensure respect for this norm through various controls. For example, in Iran, the requirement for women to wear a veil serves as an indicator of the current stance of public authorities. During periods of strict enforcement, the morality police closely monitor women, ensuring their veils are properly positioned to cover their hair. A woman with a veil placed too high, revealing the base of her hair, would be instructed to adjust it. Conversely, in more liberal periods, the state is less vigilant, allowing women to wear their veils higher on their heads, thus showing some hair. In the view of those who mandate the veil, visible hair is seen as a form of sexual aggression and nudity. The enforcement of this rule reflects the administration's position: sometimes very strict, with active morality police, and sometimes more lenient, allowing women to wear their veils less strictly.

In terms of public behavior, there has been the question of whether a woman can go outside alone. In some Muslim countries, like Saudi Arabia until recently, it was forbidden for a woman to go out alone. She had to be accompanied by a male relative—father, husband, uncle, cousin, brother, or son. Additionally, groups of women were not allowed to go out without a male present. Until about two or three years ago, women in Saudi Arabia were also forbidden from driving. Driving was considered an offense to the traditional norms governing relationships between men and women. This policy was modified recently, and now women are allowed to drive. However, this is a very recent development, and for decades, driving was strictly prohibited for moral reasons, as it was seen as contrary to the accepted norms of male-female relationships and women's expected behavior. So, from a moral perspective, these restrictions were in place to uphold what was considered appropriate conduct.

> In recent years, Saudi Arabia has implemented a series of social and legal reforms that have significantly increased women's rights and freedoms. These reforms are part of the Vision 2030 initiative, which aims to modernize the country and diversify its economy.
>
> Some key changes regarding women's rights include:
>
> 1. **Driving**: In 2018, Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on women driving, allowing them to obtain driver's licenses and drive cars.
>
> 2. **Travel**: In 2019, Saudi Arabia changed its guardianship laws, allowing women over the age of 21 to travel abroad without the need for a male guardian's permission.
>
> 3. **Employment**: Women are now allowed to work in a wider range of industries and professions, including roles that were previously restricted to men.
>
> 4. **Public Spaces**: Women can now attend sporting events, concerts, and other public gatherings, which were previously segregated or restricted.
>
> 5. **Business and Legal Affairs**: Women can now register a business, attend court sessions, and represent themselves in legal matters without a male guardian.
>
> These reforms have greatly increased the visibility and participation of women in public life in Saudi Arabia. However, cultural norms and practices may still influence the extent to which women feel comfortable or are encouraged to go out alone in certain areas.

Hisbah also encompasses various aspects related to food, such as the prohibition of eating pork and drinking alcohol. These prohibitions stem from the concept of moral behavior as dictated by God, according to their beliefs, and there is a moral obligation to adhere to these rules. In Iran, the morality police are very powerful, and failing to respect these rules can lead to prosecution. Individuals can be sentenced to jail for violating principles of morality across a range of issues. Additionally, in some countries, possessing certain books can be punishable. For instance, reading "The Satanic Verses" can result in prosecution for not respecting moral norms. In some Muslim countries, possessing a Bible—the holy book of another religion—is considered an offense to morality, applicable to Muslims and sometimes non-Muslims as well. Afghanistan is an example where such strict interpretations of morality are enforced. This strict adherence is based on their conception of moral obligations.

Of course, this does not apply to all Muslim countries. It is important to remember that while Islamic law has some general principles, its application and strictness vary widely. For example, regarding the observance of Ramadan, some countries enforce very strict adherence, meaning no one can drink or eat during the day without risking punishment. In other countries, there is a general social acceptance of Ramadan, where the majority of the population observes it out of religious belief and tradition. However, non-observance is not criminalized and does not lead to prosecution. It is more of a social practice where those not observing Ramadan might face moral condemnation but no legal consequences. In some countries, non-observance can result in legal penalties. For instance, in Afghanistan, violations can be punished by whipping or lapidation. However, this is not the case in the majority of Muslim countries. Many countries have social expectations but no legal obligations. For example, in Morocco, due to significant tourism, tourists are not required to observe Ramadan. While most of the population respects Ramadan, some may not strictly follow it, such as drinking during the day due to the heat. This might lead to social criticism, as the majority might be shocked by non-observance, but it does not result in legal prosecution. In contrast, in some countries, non-observance can lead to severe legal penalties.

> ==Lapidation==, commonly known as stoning, is a form of capital punishment where a group of people throws stones at a person until they die. This method of execution is used as a punishment for various offenses in some legal systems, particularly in certain interpretations of Islamic law (Sharia), although it is rare and highly controversial.
>
> Lapidation has historically been used to punish acts such as adultery, blasphemy, and apostasy, among others. The practice is intended to serve as a severe deterrent to others and is characterized by its public and communal nature, often involving members of the community in the execution process.
>
> Stoning is widely condemned by international human rights organizations and many countries for its brutal and inhumane nature. Efforts continue to abolish this form of punishment in places where it is still legally sanctioned.

### The notion of diya

Diya is a form of tort law, specifically relating to compensation for physical harm or injury. It represents the "price of blood," meaning it is a type of monetary compensation paid in cases of bodily injury or death. Essentially, Diya serves as financial reparation to the victim or their family for the harm caused, functioning within the legal framework to address responsibility and restitution.

> **Diya** (also spelled **Diyya**) is a concept in Islamic law that refers to compensation paid to the victim or the victim's heirs in the case of bodily harm or death. It is often described as "blood money" and is an alternative to the concept of retributive justice (qisas), where the punishment would match the crime committed, such as "an eye for an eye."
>
> Key Aspects of Diya:
>
> 1. **Compensation for Harm or Death:**
>    - Diya is a financial compensation paid to the victim or their family. The amount is determined based on the severity of the harm or the type of death.
>
> 2. **Determination of Amount:**
>    - The amount of diya can vary significantly. It is usually influenced by the victim's social status, gender, and religion. For instance, in some interpretations, the diya for a woman might be half that of a man, and the diya for a non-Muslim might differ from that for a Muslim.
>
> 3. **Types of Crimes Covered:**
>    - Diya is applicable in cases of intentional and unintentional harm. For intentional harm, it serves as a form of reparative justice, whereas for unintentional harm, it provides financial compensation for accidental injuries or deaths.
>
> 4. **Legal Framework:**
>    - Diya is deeply rooted in Sharia (Islamic law). Different schools of Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) have various interpretations and rules regarding the application and calculation of diya.
>
> 5. **Modern Application:**
>    - In many contemporary Muslim-majority countries, diya is incorporated into the legal system. For example, Saudi Arabia and Iran have specific laws detailing the application and amounts of diya. In some cases, it can be paid as an alternative to criminal prosecution, serving both as a legal and a cultural practice.
>
> Examples and Contexts:
>
> - **Saudi Arabia:** The amount of diya for a Muslim man is often standardized, and specific amounts are prescribed for various types of harm and for individuals of different statuses.
> - **Pakistan:** The legal system incorporates diya, allowing for compensation to be determined through the courts.
> - **United Arab Emirates:** The legal framework includes provisions for diya, and amounts are typically defined by law.
>
> Diya plays a crucial role in Islamic legal traditions, balancing retributive justice with reparative measures, and its application varies widely across different Muslim-majority societies.

It means, for example, if there is an accident and I lose a hand, there is a specific price for that loss. There is a kind of tariff system, and the judge will resolve the case by considering various concrete factors. For instance, if it is the hand I use to write versus my other hand, the compensation might differ. The judge will also consider whether I need my hand for my daily life or my job. If I am a worker who uses my hands to build objects, the compensation will be higher than for someone who does not work with their hands. Thus, there is a system of monetary compensation in case of physical injury.

In some Muslim countries, like Afghanistan, there is a distinction in the amount of monetary compensation between men and women. For the same injury, such as the loss of a hand, a man will receive a higher compensation than a woman, reflecting a stronger legal protection for men. Additionally, there can be differentiation in compensation amounts between Muslims and non-Muslims. For example, the hand of a Muslim might be valued higher than that of a non-Muslim. This differentiation means that in cases of accidents and subsequent monetary compensation, there can be variations based on these factors. It is important to note that this does not apply to all Muslim countries; it is a possibility allowed by the classical tort law system. Some Muslim countries practice this system, while others do not, leading to different applications and interpretations.

For example, in Iran, the difference between Muslim and non-Muslim compensation does not exist. This means that in Iran, compensation would be the same for a Muslim or a non-Muslim. For decades, even centuries, Iran has recognized the presence of non-Muslim minorities living within its territory, and these minorities are protected by Islamic law. While the majority of the population in Iran is Muslim, specifically of the Shiite branch, there are also local minorities, including followers of Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism is one of the oldest religions in the world, practiced for 3,000 to 4,000 years, and it has a traditional presence in Iran. Additionally, Iran has Christian minorities, primarily Armenians. Many Armenian merchants came to Iran during the 19th and 20th centuries for business. Following the Armenian genocide during World War I, some survivors settled in Iran. They have now lived there for more than a century and are recognized as a minority. This recognition ensures that in cases of monetary compensation, these minorities are treated equally with the Muslim majority.

> **Zoroastrianism** is an ancient religion founded by the prophet Zoroaster (Zarathustra) around 3,500 years ago in Persia (modern-day Iran). It centers on the worship of Ahura Mazda, the god of light and goodness, in opposition to Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), the spirit of evil. Key texts include the Avesta, with the Gathas being its oldest part.
>
> Core Beliefs:
>
> - **Dualism:** The ongoing battle between good (Ahura Mazda) and evil (Angra Mainyu).
> - **Ethics:** Emphasis on Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds.
> - **Fire Worship:** Fire symbolizes purity and the divine, and is central to rituals.
>
> Practices:
>
> - **Rituals:** Include the Yasna ceremony and rites of passage.
> - **Fire Temples:** Sacred fires are kept burning continuously.
>
> Historical and Modern Influence:
>
> - Dominated ancient Persian empires (Achaemenid, Parthian, Sassanian).
> - Influenced other major religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
> - Modern communities mainly in India (Parsis) and Iran, facing challenges in maintaining traditions.

But in Afghanistan, it's not the case. In Afghanistan, you still have this distinction between Muslim and non-Muslim, and in Iran, it used to be the case, also in Pakistan, but there was a reform about a few years ago, and after this reform, also in Pakistan, they decided to make an equality between Muslims and non-Muslims.

> In Pakistan, the concept of Diya (blood money) has been reformed significantly to address issues of gender and religious equality. Historically, the amount of Diya paid for a female victim was half that of a male victim, and the amount for non-Muslims was different from that for Muslims, reflecting broader societal inequalities.
>
> Key Reforms:
>
> 1. **Gender Equality:**
>    - The Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act, 2006, was a landmark piece of legislation aimed at eliminating gender disparity in Diya compensation. This act mandated that the Diya for a woman should be equal to that of a man, aligning compensation for female victims with that of male victims.
>
> 2. **Religious Equality:**
>    - In 2004, the Pakistani government took significant steps to reform Diya laws to ensure that the amount of Diya paid was the same regardless of the victim's religion. This move was crucial in promoting equality among all citizens and ensuring that non-Muslim citizens received equal treatment under the law.
>
> 3. **Legal Codification:**
>    - The Qisas and Diyat Ordinance of 1990 laid the groundwork for these reforms by codifying the principles of Islamic criminal law, including provisions for Diya. Over time, amendments and additional legislation have sought to refine and enforce these principles more equitably.
>
> Impact:
>
> These reforms represent a significant shift towards gender and religious equality in Pakistan's legal system, aligning with international human rights standards. They reflect ongoing efforts to modernize the legal framework and ensure that all citizens, regardless of gender or religion, receive equal justice.
>
> These reforms demonstrate Pakistan's commitment to addressing historical inequalities and ensuring that its legal practices are more inclusive and just.

### The notion of contract in the Islam law system

#### Matrimonial contracts

In contract law, there is a specific topic concerning matrimonial contracts. These are agreements signed between individuals before a wedding. A matrimonial contract is a written financial agreement signed in the presence of two witnesses. It generally concerns the payment of what is called "mahr," which means the price of the bride. This price is the amount that the husband or his family must pay to the bride's ~~father~~ when a woman is married. The payment can be made in money, property, or various other forms of assets.

> ==**Mahr**==, also known as **dower** or **bride price**, is a mandatory gift given by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage in Islamic law. It is a fundamental aspect of an Islamic marriage contract and represents the groom's commitment and responsibility towards the bride. The concept of mahr is derived from the Quran and Hadith, and it is a legal and financial right of the bride.
>
> Key Aspects of Mahr:
>
> 1. **Definition and Purpose:**
>    - **Mahr** is a sum of money or possessions paid by the groom to the bride upon marriage. It can be immediate (given at the time of marriage) or deferred (promised to be given at a later date).
>    - The purpose of mahr is to provide financial security to the bride and to serve as a token of respect and commitment from the groom.
>
> 2. **Quranic Basis:**
>    - The concept of mahr is mentioned in the Quran in several verses, such as in Surah An-Nisa (4:4): "And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts graciously. But if they give up willingly to you anything of it, then take it in satisfaction and ease."
>
> 3. **Types of Mahr:**
>    - **Prompt Mahr (Mahr Mu'ajjal):** This is given to the bride at the time of the marriage ceremony.
>    - **Deferred Mahr (Mahr Muwajjal):** This is a promised amount to be paid at a later date, often upon divorce or the death of the husband.
>
> 4. **Determination of Amount:**
>    - The amount and form of mahr are typically agreed upon by the bride and groom (or their families) during the marriage contract negotiations. It can range from a nominal amount to substantial wealth, depending on the agreement and cultural practices.
>
> 5. **Legal and Cultural Variations:**
>    - While the basic concept of mahr is consistent across Islamic cultures, its application and significance can vary widely. In some cultures, it may be a mere symbolic gesture, while in others, it could be a substantial financial arrangement.
>
> 6. **Rights and Obligations:**
>    - Mahr is the exclusive right of the bride, and she has full autonomy over how it is used. The groom is legally obligated to fulfill the mahr agreement as part of the marriage contract.
>
> Contemporary Context:
> In modern times, the concept of mahr continues to be a crucial element of Islamic marriages, although its practical application can vary based on regional, cultural, and socio-economic factors. It remains a significant symbol of the groom’s commitment and the bride’s financial security.

When the family of the husband cannot pay the price, it indicates that they are very poor. There is social pressure for families to marry within the same social level, and part of this pressure includes the expectation to pay the bridal price. Sometimes, families are forced to sell properties to afford this payment, as it is seen as a matter of social honor and tradition.

*In this respect, Islamic countries are similar to China? Or is the professor confusing Islamic countries with China?*

In reality, this principle, which is one of the main tenets of the Islamic law system, is applied variably across different states. For example, in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, this rule is strictly enforced and practiced. Before a wedding, there is typically a lengthy negotiation between the groom's family and the bride's family to determine the bride price and the bride's financial status. At this stage, provisions for the bride's future, including her potential status as a widow, are considered. The contract often includes guarantees that, should she become a widow, she will have financial protection, a home, and sufficient funds for her livelihood. As discussed earlier, the situation differs for women with sons versus those without children. A widow with no children is entirely dependent on her husband's family’s willingness to support her. Consequently, some widows are well cared for by respectful families, while others without children may be treated poorly, living as servants under the control of their in-laws. To avoid such uncertainties, some families include detailed provisions in the matrimonial contract to ensure the widow's well-being and prevent unpleasant surprises.

In some countries, like Afghanistan or Pakistan, these rules are strictly applied. In other countries, such as Morocco or Tunisia, these rules exist but primarily as social practices. In Morocco or Tunisia, matrimonial contracts and the bride price involve negotiation, but the focus is more on tradition than legal obligation. In these contexts, the bride price is symbolic rather than mandatory. For example, in urban areas of Morocco, the bride price is often not practiced at all, reflecting the modern lifestyle of the population. When it is practiced, it is more of a social gesture than a legal requirement, with gifts being symbolic rather than substantial.

In contrast, in rural areas, especially among farmers, the bride price remains significant. It is more commonly practiced because it provides essential resources for the new couple to start their life together. In these areas, the bride price might include property such as fields or houses. The husband's family might provide a house and a field, while the bride's family might contribute another field and essential household items. This practice remains important in rural areas as it helps the couple establish a livelihood. However, in urban areas, where people live in a more globalized environment, the practice is largely symbolic and not strictly followed.

#### Contracts about property

A contract regarding property transfer can occur in three ways, each with its own type of contract. The first way is purchase, where someone buys the property from another person. The second way is inheritance, where the property is received through the succession of someone who has died. The third way is donation, where the property is given without any payment. In a donation, the owner transfers the property to another person as a gift. Each of these methods involves a specific type of contract tailored to the nature of the transaction.

Regarding inheritance, in many Muslim countries, even the more liberal ones, the system generally favors men over women. This means that a sister typically receives about half of what her brother receives. This inequality exists in many countries. Currently, in Morocco, there are movements advocating for real equality between brothers and sisters, and a commission is working on this issue. The same is happening in Tunisia. This inequality stems from the traditional view that property and land transmission are expressions of bloodline, which is considered to be primarily through the father's side. As a result, the most important familial link is with the father's side, leading to the practice where a sister receives only half of what her brother receives. It is generally the same for the wife. When the wife becomes a widow, even if she can receive something from her husband, it is usually a smaller portion compared to what the sons or brothers of the husband receive. This highlights the importance of the matrimonial contract. The matrimonial contract provides a way to anticipate and mitigate the risk of the bride having no means of support when she becomes a widow.

The norm is that the wife or sister receives only half of what a man would receive. Additionally, when it comes to witnesses, a woman's testimony is often considered to be worth half that of a man's. This means that if there is one male witness and one female witness, the man's testimony will be given greater weight, with the man's testimony being valued at 2 and the woman's at 1. This is a general principle, but it is not systematically applied in all Muslim countries. Some countries do accept the equal value of testimonies from both men and women.

> In some Islamic countries, a man's testimony is considered more valuable than that of a woman, often based on traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Here are a few examples:
>
> 1. **Saudi Arabia**:
>    - In Saudi Arabia, traditional interpretations of Sharia law hold that the testimony of a man is generally considered equivalent to that of two women in certain legal matters, such as in financial transactions and criminal cases. This is based on the Quranic verse in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:282), which mentions that two women can serve as witnesses if one forgets, the other can remind her.
>
> 2. **Iran**:
>    - In Iran, the legal system also follows the principle that a man's testimony is worth more than a woman's in certain cases. This is particularly evident in criminal cases, where the testimony of two women is often required to counterbalance the testimony of one man.
>
> 3. **Pakistan**:
>    - While Pakistan's legal system is influenced by both Islamic and common law principles, in certain areas of Islamic family law and Hudood Ordinances, the testimony of a man is considered equivalent to that of two women. This applies in cases related to financial transactions and some criminal offenses.
>
> 4. **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**:
>    - In the UAE, particularly in the Sharia courts, the testimony of one man can be considered equal to that of two women in specific cases. This is particularly applicable in financial and certain criminal cases.
>
> 5. **Yemen**:
>    - In Yemen, traditional Sharia law is applied in many aspects of the legal system. Here, the testimony of two women is often required to equal that of one man, especially in cases involving financial transactions and certain types of legal disputes.

#### Contracts for business

In business law, the traditional principle was that both written and oral contracts were accepted. When dealing with oral contracts, proof could be problematic, and witnesses were used to resolve this issue. In some countries, all witnesses are considered equal. However, in other countries, the testimony of a non-Muslim or a woman was traditionally considered unequal compared to that of a man. This principle was prevalent in many Muslim countries. Recent reforms have changed this, as seen in Pakistan, where the testimony of a non-Muslim now holds the same value as that of a Muslim. However, this equality was not recognized for centuries.

### Criminal law in Islamic law system

In fact, there are significant differences in criminal law across different countries. Many of these differences arise from the religious aspects of criminal law. When discussing criminal law, we can distinguish between general criminal law—applied to common offenses such as robbery, violence, etc.—and the religious aspects of criminal law.

#### General criminal law

In Muslim countries that were once part of a colonial system, some rules from the former colonial system still exist. For example, in the Maghreb region—Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia—the judicial system and criminal code are significantly influenced by practices from the continental system, specifically the French system.

> The Maghreb region refers to the northwestern part of Africa, encompassing Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania. The name "Maghreb" derives from the Arabic term for "the West" or "sunset," indicating its location relative to the Arab world. This region is known for its diverse cultural heritage influenced by ancient Berber, Arab, and French colonial histories. Geographically, it includes the Atlas Mountains, Mediterranean coastlines, and the Sahara Desert. Politically and economically, the Maghreb countries vary in stability and development and are part of the Arab Maghreb Union aimed at fostering regional cooperation .

For example, in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, there is a dual judicial system. One system handles administrative law for controlling the executive branch, and another deals with judicial law for the application of private and criminal law. This setup involves two types of judges, or magistrates. The division between administrative judges and judicial judges is a characteristic of the continental law system, particularly the French legal system. France exported this system to its colonies during colonization, and when these countries gained independence, they retained this judicial structure. Consequently, the organization of justice in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia is minimally influenced by traditional Islamic law and primarily follows the main rules of the French legal system.

> After gaining independence, Algeria undertook several legal reforms to gradually move away from the French colonial legal system. Although some French colonial laws remained in use initially, the Algerian government initiated a series of legal and constitutional reforms to establish an independent legal system.
>
> Key Stages of Legal Reforms:
>
> 1. **Transitional Period Post-Independence (1962-1963)**:
>    - After gaining independence in 1962, Algeria temporarily retained some French colonial laws to ensure basic societal functioning and stability.
>    - The adoption of the first Algerian Constitution in 1963 marked the beginning of establishing its own legal system.
>
> 2. **Localization and Arabization of the Legal System (Late 1960s-1970s)**:
>    - During this period, the Algerian government gradually introduced and modified laws to align with Algeria's social and cultural realities.
>    - Many laws were translated into Arabic and revised to meet the needs of the Algerian context.
>
> 3. **Further Legal and Constitutional Reforms (1980s-1990s)**:
>    - The new constitution adopted in 1989 reflected trends of multiparty democracy and political liberalization.
>    - Legal reforms during this time also emphasized the rule of law and human rights protection.
>
> 4. **Consolidation of the Modern Legal System (2000s and Beyond)**:
>    - Algeria continued to advance legal reforms, aiming to align with international law while maintaining national sovereignty and uniqueness.
>
> Overall, Algeria's post-independence legal reforms were a continuous process aimed at building an independent and country-specific legal system while maintaining social stability. These reforms not only demonstrated Algeria's sovereign independence but also showcased the distinctiveness and progressiveness of its legal culture.

We can observe the same pattern in former British colonies, including those with significant Muslim populations, where the common law system is applied. This means that justice functions similarly to the common law system, with a judge presiding over the bench and a prosecution process aligned with common law principles. The organization of justice in these regions is inspired by the common law system. However, the extent of this influence varies. For instance, in India, which has states with Muslim majorities, common law is widely applied. In Pakistan, the situation is different. Pakistan, being a Muslim country, incorporates elements from Islamic tradition, particularly in defining offenses. The Pakistani Criminal Code includes definitions derived from Islamic law, not common law. However, during trials, many procedural rules are influenced by the common law system. In both India and Pakistan, as well as other former British colonies, the education of lawyers is based on the principles of the British legal system. This results in a legal framework that combines elements of traditional Islamic law with aspects of the common law system.

In other Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, there is no formal criminal code. In Saudi Arabia, the prosecution and definition of crimes are derived from the Quran and the Islamic legal system. This means that in Saudi Arabia, the Quran serves both as a religious and a legal text. The definition and prosecution of crimes are based on the Quran and the interpretations of scholars using various sources. Consequently, there is no distinct criminal code or secular criminal law; religious law is the criminal law.

Note that similar principles can be found in the Bible. If you read the Old Testament, you will find prayers, historical accounts of the Jewish people, and legal texts, including descriptions of crimes, offenses, and fair contracts. Historically, some Christian communities used the Bible as a legal book for centuries, though this is rarely the case today. However, the Bible continues to be used as a legal source by rabbinic tribunals. For instance, in Israel and other countries, rabbinic tribunals may resolve cases related to family or business law. Sometimes, individuals choose to bring their cases before rabbinic justice rather than civil courts.

In some countries, resolving disputes through religious tribunals is legally permitted. For example, in the province of Ontario, Canada, if a conflict arises between two people of the same religion, such as two Muslims or two Jews, they can choose to address certain issues, like business or family matters, in a religious tribunal. However, if the conflict involves individuals of different religions, or if one party refuses to use the religious system, it is not possible. But if both parties agree to go before a religious tribunal, it is allowed. These rabbinic tribunals can resolve specific cases using the Bible, rabbinic tradition, and centuries of rabbinic commentaries on the Bible.

It is exactly the same intellectual conception as with the Quran. In this case, however, only the religious books serve as law books. This means that in some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, all criminal cases are resolved using the Islamic law system.

> The primary countries that operate exclusively under Sharia law without a separate secular legal system are:
>
> 1. Saudi Arabia
>    - **Legal System**: Saudi Arabia's legal system is based entirely on Sharia law, derived from the Quran and the Hadiths (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). There is no codified constitution or secular laws.
>    - **Judicial System**: The judiciary interprets Sharia law and applies it to all aspects of life, including criminal, civil, and family matters.
>
> 2. Iran
>    - **Legal System**: Iran's legal system combines theocratic principles with elements of civil law, but Sharia law is the ultimate authority. The country's legal framework is heavily based on Islamic jurisprudence.
>    - **Constitution**: The Iranian constitution declares Islam (specifically, Twelver Ja'fari Shia Islam) as the basis of all legislation.
>
> Other Notable Mentions:
>
> - **Afghanistan**: Under the Taliban regime, Afghanistan's legal system is based on Sharia law. However, the implementation and strictness can vary depending on the political climate.
> - **Somalia**: Certain regions in Somalia, particularly those controlled by Islamist groups like Al-Shabaab, enforce Sharia law exclusively.
>
> These countries and regions apply Sharia law in varying degrees, but Saudi Arabia and Iran are the most notable for having legal systems that rely solely on Sharia without separate secular laws.

In the Kingdom of Brunei, there is a specific criminal code called the Sharia Tribunal Code. This means that the code contains texts that have been voted on by parliament or enforced by the government, along with references to legal principles from the Islamic law system. In Yemen, there is a local criminal code that includes texts enforced by the government that incorporate general concepts from traditional Islamic law. In summary, there is a range of implementations: in Saudi Arabia, the Quran serves as the criminal code; in Brunei, there is a code that combines specific laws with elements of Islamic law; and in Yemen, the code is based on general principles of Islamic tradition.

##### Qisas

In many Islamic countries, there is the application of the Diya system, which involves monetary compensation. In a few countries, the Qisas system is also applied, which involves compensation by revenge, essentially the price of blood. An example of this exists in Albania, in the Balkans. Albania has a unique situation; officially, it has a constitution with liberal principles. This means that Albania's criminal law system is inspired by European standards, particularly in criminal law, as Albania is a member of the Council of Europe and aspires to join the European Union. Albania has a majority Muslim population and a minority of Christians, but it is not considered an Islamic nation in the sense that Islamic rule governs the country. Instead, the state is neutral, even though it acknowledges that the majority of its population is Muslim.

> **Qisas** is an Islamic legal principle meaning "retaliation in kind" or "eye for an eye." It is one of the main categories of Islamic criminal jurisprudence dealing with offenses against the person, such as murder or bodily injury.
>
> Key Aspects of Qisas:
>
> 1. **Retaliation**:
>    - In cases of intentional murder or bodily harm, Qisas allows the victim or the victim's family to seek equivalent retaliation against the perpetrator. For example, if someone is murdered, the family has the right to demand the execution of the murderer.
>
> 2. **Forgiveness and Compensation**:
>    - Instead of retaliation, the victim or the victim's family can forgive the offender or accept monetary compensation (diya or blood money). This option is encouraged in Islam and is considered a virtuous act.
>
> 3. **Legal Framework**:
>    - Qisas is based on verses from the Quran, such as in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:178): "O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution (Qisas) for those murdered..." and Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:45): "And We ordained therein for them: a life for a life, an eye for an eye..."
>
> 4. **Application**:
>    - The implementation of Qisas varies among Islamic countries. In some countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Pakistan, Qisas is part of the legal system, while other countries may incorporate it to different extents.
>
> Qisas represents a system of justice that emphasizes proportional retaliation while also offering a path towards mercy and compensation.

In Albania, certain judicial traditions persist among parts of the population, one of which is known as KANUN. KANUN is a form of customary law, and one of its key aspects is the right of revenge through the "price of blood." For example, if a man is killed—whether by murder or accident—the official law in Albania mandates a police investigation, a trial, and a potential penalty. However, social pressure often dictates that this is not enough. The family of the deceased may feel entitled to seek satisfaction through revenge.

This revenge typically involves negotiation between the two families, especially in rural areas where extended families, including grandparents and cousins, are common. Sometimes, the price of revenge is monetary: "You killed my brother, so you will pay this amount to the family." But often, the families cannot agree on a price, leading to an unofficial yet effective system of revenge. In some cases, the person responsible for the death—whether accidental or intentional—may spend years confined to their home, fearing for their life because the message is clear: if they go outside, they will be killed. Even going into the garden can be dangerous, as there may be someone nearby ready to exact revenge.

In more intense family feuds, if the intended target does not go outside, other family members might become victims. This tradition of revenge exists not only within the Muslim population in Albania but also among the Christian population. The KANUN can be seen as a form of Qisas, a system of compensation through revenge. In some villages, these blood feuds can lead to continuous cycles of killing, with one death avenging another, and so on.

Many Albanians seeking asylum in European countries cite these revenge wars as the reason they can no longer live safely in their homeland. They often claim that local authorities are unable to protect them due to high levels of corruption. In some cases, police and judges are reluctant to intervene, either because they are connected to one of the families involved or because the family is powerful and opposing them would be dangerous. In other cases, authorities may expect bribes before taking action, further illustrating the corruption that exacerbates these revenge conflicts. This situation exemplifies the deeply ingrained system of revenge in certain parts of Albania.

> **Kanun** in Albania refers to a traditional set of customary laws that governed many aspects of social, legal, and cultural life, particularly in the northern highlands of Albania. The Kanun is most famously associated with the **Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini**, a code believed to have been codified by Lekë Dukagjini, a medieval Albanian prince, although its origins likely predate him.
>
> Key Aspects of the Kanun:
>
> 1. **Oral Tradition**:
>    - The Kanun was originally an oral code passed down through generations and was only written down in the 20th century. It encapsulates a wide range of social norms and rules governing everything from property rights to marriage, inheritance, and hospitality.
>
> 2. **Principle of Honor**:
>    - A central concept in the Kanun is **"Besa"** (a word that signifies faith, trust, and keeping one's word) and **honor**. Honor is crucial in the Kanun, and many of its laws are designed to protect and preserve family and personal honor.
>
> 3. **Blood Feuds (Gjakmarrja)**:
>    - One of the most notorious aspects of the Kanun is the practice of blood feuds, known as **Gjakmarrja**. If a member of a family was killed, the Kanun mandated that the victim’s family had the right to seek revenge by killing the murderer or a male member of his family. This practice led to cycles of violence and could extend over generations.
>
> 4. **Legal and Social Structure**:
>    - The Kanun provided a comprehensive legal framework that addressed issues like property disputes, marriage and family law, crimes, and punishment. It also prescribed rules for hospitality, which were highly valued and strictly followed.
>
> 5. **Modern Relevance**:
>    - Although the Kanun was largely superseded by formal legal systems during the 20th century, elements of it, particularly blood feuds, have persisted in some rural areas, leading to serious social issues even in modern Albania.
>
> The Kanun remains an important cultural and historical part of Albania's identity, illustrating the complexities of customary law and its impact on society.

The system of revenge also used to exist in Afghanistan, particularly in rural areas rather than urban ones. In these rural areas, especially in some mountainous regions, there were very small villages where conflicts often arose between different villages, tribes, etc. Before the arrival of the Taliban, it was common for families to organize acts of revenge against other families. However, this practice appears to have diminished significantly due to the strong authority of the Taliban, who opposed the system of revenge. The Taliban's position was that justice comes from God, and therefore, if there is a dispute between two people or two families, the case must be presented before Islamic justice rather than being resolved through personal acts of revenge.

Before the Taliban's rise to power, during periods of anarchy when the country lacked a central government, the system of revenge was quite prevalent. This system also existed during the Soviet period. In areas controlled by the Soviets, the revenge system was not practiced because the population was under the rule of the Red Army. However, in regions where resistance to the Soviets was active and government control was weak, the revenge system developed within families or local communities. While this system used to be more common, it is not widely practiced today.

In the vast majority of Muslim countries, while monetary compensation, similar to what exists in tort law systems in many other countries, is sometimes practiced, the system of revenge is generally no longer used. There are a few exceptions, such as in Albania and Afghanistan, but these are very rare cases.

#### Religious aspect of crime

In many Muslim countries, the protection of religious freedom is not fully guaranteed and is not always upheld. Some Muslim countries allow the freedom to practice religion, but there are also countries where this freedom is either not recognized or very limited. In the Islamic legal system, there is penal protection of religion. This means that in some cases, acts such as disrespecting Islam or attempting to change one's religion are considered criminal offenses and are prosecuted as such by the courts.

##### Apostasy

Apostasy refers to the act of converting to another religion or renouncing one's current religion. In Western countries, the guarantee of religious freedom is very clear. This freedom means that anyone is free to believe or not believe, convert to another religion, or renounce their faith altogether. For example, if you grew up in a religious family and, upon becoming an adult, decide that your own philosophical understanding of life and the world leads you to no longer believe in God, you have the right to make that choice. Apostasy specifically refers to the decision to abandon the religion you previously practiced and possibly convert to another.

In the Muslim legal system, apostasy is considered a criminal offense that, in some countries, can be punished by the death penalty. There is also a concept known as the system of retraction. This means that if someone who has converted to another religion is discovered and put on trial, they can express regret and retract their conversion, deciding to return to Islam. In such cases, the death penalty is avoided, but the individual may still face imprisonment or, in some instances, only receive a warning from the judge. The outcome varies depending on the country. Under classical Islamic law, apostasy traditionally warrants the death penalty, but its application differs across countries. For example, in Morocco and Tunisia, the death penalty is not applied for apostasy, but it is still not acceptable for someone to renounce Islam and convert to another religion. This is the essence of apostasy in these legal contexts.

> Renouncing Islam, known as **apostasy**, is addressed differently across Islamic countries, with legal responses ranging from severe penalties to no official sanctions. Here's an overview:
>
> 1. **Countries Where Apostasy is Criminalized and Punishable by Death**:
>    - **Saudi Arabia**: Operates under a strict interpretation of Sharia law, considering apostasy a capital offense.
>    - **Iran**: Apostasy can lead to the death penalty, particularly under conservative interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence.
>    - **Afghanistan**: Especially under Taliban governance, apostasy is deemed a grave crime, potentially resulting in execution.
>    - **Qatar and Mauritania**: Legally prescribe the death penalty for apostasy, though enforcement is rare.
>
> 2. **Countries with Other Penalties for Apostasy**:
>    - **Malaysia**: Does not impose the death penalty but may subject individuals to detention in rehabilitation centers aimed at reconversion.
>    - **Maldives**: Apostasy can result in the revocation of citizenship.
>
> 3. **Countries Where Apostasy is Not Criminalized**:
>    - **Turkey**: Maintains a secular legal framework with no laws against apostasy.
>    - **Tunisia**: Upholds individual freedoms without criminalizing apostasy.
>    - **Albania**: Operates under a secular constitution, imposing no legal penalties for renouncing Islam.
>    - **Indonesia**: Lacks national laws against apostasy, though local regulations and societal pressures may vary.
>
>It's important to note that even in countries without legal repercussions, social consequences such as ostracism, familial estrangement, or threats to personal safety can be significant for those who choose to leave Islam.

##### Blasphemy

Blasphemy refers to any act of questioning or challenging sacred texts, holiness, God, or the personality of the Prophet Muhammad. It involves expressing a free opinion about a religious aspect. In Western countries, freedom of religion is closely tied to freedom of opinion and freedom of speech. This means that individuals in Western countries are free to believe, not believe, or change their religion, and they are also free to discuss and critique the principles of any religion. Freedom of speech allows anyone to express their own views on life, the world, religion, philosophy, etc., and to disagree with the official positions of any religion.

In any religion, there is a corpus of texts and principles considered sacred by its followers, and these principles are called dogmas. A dogma is a belief that is accepted as true without requiring proof. In scientific methodology, something is considered true only if it can be proven—whether through experience, study, or analysis. In science—be it human sciences, social sciences, or the natural sciences like physics, mathematics, and biology—the principle is that a statement must be proven with evidence to be accepted as true. For instance, we know that water boils at 100 degrees because repeated experiments have confirmed this. This is scientific proof through experience.

In philosophy or religion, however, a dogma is an assertion that believers accept as true without requiring evidence. This concept is not exclusive to Islam. For example, in Christianity, one dogma is the belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Another is the belief that Jesus Christ is both fully man and fully God. These are dogmas—affirmations considered to be true by Christians. However, believers of other religions may not accept these dogmas. They might believe that Jesus Christ was merely a man, perhaps a prophet, but not divine or the Son of God. If you are a believer, you follow the dogmas without requiring evidence. In a liberal society, however, people have the right to challenge these beliefs. They can say, "I don't believe this dogma is true," and are free to propose alternative interpretations or beliefs. This is how freedom of speech and freedom of religion function.

The notion of blasphemy involves penal punishment for expressing ideas that challenge or contradict a religious dogma. Blasphemy is essentially a way of saying, "I will punish you because you don't accept, practice, or recognize this dogma," even though the dogma itself cannot be proven. A dogma is something that cannot be proven; it is a deeply held belief that the believer accepts as truth. The believer considers the dogma to be a clear and undeniable truth, but it cannot be empirically proven, and no one can prove a dogma.

In a liberal analysis, freedom of speech means that anyone is free to believe in a dogma or to challenge it, and contesting a dogma is not a criminal offense. It is your right to believe or not believe. Of course, there can be private consequences. For example, if you are a member of a religion and you advocate positions that contradict the dogma, you may be expelled from the religion. In the Christian Church, this is known as excommunication. Excommunication occurs when someone who was a member of the church is removed because they defended ideas that go against the dogma. However, excommunication is a private punishment, not a criminal one. It is not adjudicated by the legal system but is an internal matter of the religious group—a sanction within the group. You are no longer a member of the church or a follower of that religion, but there are no civil or criminal repercussions.

When we speak about blasphemy, it means that opposing the dogma is not merely an internal matter within a religion or a private issue but becomes a public concern that is punishable under criminal law. Blasphemy involves contesting the dogma, and in the Islamic penal system, it is considered a criminal offense. The punishment for blasphemy varies depending on the country. In some places, it can result in imprisonment, flogging, or whipping. In more severe cases, it can be punished by hanging or decapitation, depending on the country's legal system.

This is not the situation in all Muslim countries. In some Muslim countries, blasphemy is not a significant issue in the public sphere. For example, in Albania, people can change their religion without facing criminal punishment, although there may be some social pressure. However, in countries like Iran or Afghanistan, changing your religion can lead to the death penalty, either because you want to convert or because you are accused of blasphemy. In these countries, you can be prosecuted for blasphemy. For instance, in Afghanistan, if someone publicly criticizes the Taliban's application of Sharia and is arrested, they may face whipping or even hanging. This is not the case in all countries. In Morocco, for example, there is social pressure, and you may face challenges, particularly if you are a public servant expected to adhere to religious rules. However, this is more about social pressure than a strict penal system. In some countries, harsher punishments like hanging still exist, but this is not universal. While such punishments were more common in the past, they are still present in certain countries today.
