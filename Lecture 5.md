## Sources of Islamic laws

### Quran

The Quran, which means "recitation," contains over 600 verses with legal implications, serving as the basis for statutory law in Islamic legal systems. Islamic law dictates that every human action in daily life must strictly adhere to God's law as outlined in the Quran. Believers consider the Quran as the voice of God, directly revealed through the testimony of faith. Consequently, followers are required to strictly adhere to Islamic law, which is viewed as definitive and immutable.

> The testimony of faith, known as the Shahada in Islam, is a declaration affirming the central belief in the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad. It is recited by Muslims as a public declaration of their faith and consists of two parts:
>
> 1. "La ilaha illallah" (There is no god but Allah): This affirms the belief in the absolute oneness of God, emphasizing that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.
>
> 2. "Muhammadun rasulullah" (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah): This acknowledges Muhammad as the final prophet and messenger of Allah, through whom the Quran was revealed.
>
> The Shahada is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is recited by Muslims in various religious rituals and daily prayers.

#### Different interpretations of Islamic law

Islamic law is not very adaptable to modern legal systems because the Quran is not easily changed, except in some cases where interpretations by scholars allow for flexibility. As a result, adherence to Islamic law is often strict. It's important to note that the application of Islamic law varies significantly between different countries, with some adopting more liberal interpretations and applications of the text.

For example, in France, there are three interpretations regarding the wearing of the veil. Some texts suggest that women should be cautious about their attire, while others advocate for wearing a veil. Additionally, historical customs reveal instances where non-Muslim women wore veils. This practice traces back to many civilizations that sought to control women by concealing their hair.

Considering the varying opinions on wearing veils, the Minister of Home Affairs, who also oversees religious affairs in France, conducted an official visit to Egypt. During this visit, he met with esteemed scholars at the renowned Islamic university in Cairo to inquire about the official stance on wearing veils. These scholars, being from one of the most prestigious Muslim universities globally, are considered authoritative voices on the matter. They expressed that Muslim women are obliged to wear the veil in Muslim-majority countries, while Muslims residing in non-Muslim countries should adhere to local customs. Therefore, in Western countries, Muslim women can wear veils unless prohibited by local laws. For instance, in France, wearing veils under certain circumstances is forbidden. For example, when you are in college or you are a civil servant during service, individuals must comply with these regulations. That's one point of view.

You have certain points of view given by liberal Muslim muftis, and one of them was very famous. Some years ago, he was the mufti of a big mosque in Marseille. This Imam is considered a leader of liberal interpretations of Islam in Western countries. He stated that Muslims living in Western countries must adapt their faith to the civil law of the country where they reside. We have to carefully consider the obligations that believers must absolutely follow and determine which rules can be adapted based on the local context. Wearing a veil is not a religious command; it is considered a tradition that existed in ancient Arabia during the time of the Prophet. He emphasized that all interpretations of Islamic law are linked to geographical criteria. These rules were established in societies that mandated veiling for women. Therefore, living in Western countries, there is absolutely no obligation for women to wear a veil. The fundamental practices of the Muslim religion do not dictate the wearing of a veil.

> A ==mufti== is an Islamic scholar who is qualified to interpret Islamic law (Sharia) and issue legal opinions (fatwas) on specific religious matters. These legal opinions often address questions related to religious practices, social issues, ethics, and personal conduct in accordance with Islamic principles. Muftis play an important role in providing guidance to Muslims on how to apply Islamic teachings to their daily lives.
>
> An Imam is an Islamic leadership position, often the worship leader of a mosque and the community. In Sunni Islam, the Imam leads the prayers; in Shia Islam, the Imam leads the community both politically and religiously. The term can also refer more broadly to a knowledgeable person who leads prayers, teaches Islam, and serves as a spiritual guide.

And you have a third interpretation given by scholars, particularly those in Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan, countries that practice very strict Islam. In these states, scholars say it is written in the Quran and in the tradition that Muslim women have to wear a veil, making it a legal and religious obligation for them to do so. For example, in Saudi Arabia, there is a distinction between local women, who are Muslim and must wear a veil, and foreigners living in the country, who are not obliged to wear one. This distinction is maintained. However, this distinction does not apply in Iran. In Iran, all women, whether Muslim or not, Iranian or not Iranian, must wear a veil when they are outside. It is considered a legal offense not to wear a veil or to wear one without covering the hair.

With this example, you can see that for the same question, we have different answers provided by various countries and schools of Islamic law. And so it means that, on the one hand, we can say that, yes, Islamic law is definitive and immutable; it is definitively written and cannot be changed, but on the other hand, we can see that we can have the same text with different interpretations; some interpretations can be very conservative, others can be liberal. In France, it’s a very old and hot debate.

*There are many countries where Muslim law is obligatory, alongside obligations stemming from other traditions. For example, legal traditions inherited from the colonial period may also coexist. In such cases, Muslim principles may be applied within a broader legal framework that includes elements from civil law and other legal systems.*

#### Different societies in the Islamic world

In the 1970s, Afghanistan was considered one of the most liberal countries in the Islamic world. For instance, women had the freedom to pursue education at universities without facing discrimination. Additionally, the fashion and lifestyle in urban areas resembled that of Europe or California. This illustrates that freedoms are not always permanent, and sometimes religious beliefs can challenge liberties that are supposed to be protected by law or constitution.

The shift in Afghanistan's social dynamics can be partly attributed to the Soviet invasion in the 1970s. The Soviet Union supported the Communist Party, which had a strict stance against religious freedom. Consequently, resistance against the Soviet occupation also became a resurgence of religious identity for many Afghans. This phenomenon was not unique to Afghanistan; similar dynamics were observed in Iran.

Both Afghanistan and Iran experienced a coexistence of liberal urban centers and conservative rural areas. However, when power shifted in urban areas, there was a widespread embrace of religious sentiments throughout society. In Iran, the Shah aimed to modernize the country economically and administratively while maintaining a conservative political system. The revolutions in both countries were, paradoxically, conservative in nature: in Afghanistan, aimed against the Soviet Union, and in Iran, against Western values.

> In Iran, the term "Shah" historically refers to the title of the monarch, equivalent to a king or emperor. Before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iran was ruled by a Shah, specifically Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. However, after the revolution, Iran became an Islamic Republic, and the title of Shah was abolished in favor of a system of governance led by a Supreme Leader and elected officials.

Before these revolutions, Islam was more of a cultural expression for many Iranians, akin to how Christmas may be celebrated in Western countries—some as a religious belief, others as tradition, and some purely commercially. Similarly, in Iran, religious practices were diverse, with many urban dwellers engaging in cultural rather than strictly religious expressions of faith.

Algeria gained independence in 1962, and in the initial years post-independence, it leaned towards a communist ideology. Consequently, the government's stance on religion was ambiguous. Some officials echoed Karl Marx's view that religion serves as an opiate for the masses, implying that it should be downplayed. This ambivalence towards religion was evident as Christians, and Jews, predominantly French citizens, left Algeria around 1962, resulting in a predominantly Muslim population. During the 1970s, possibly influenced by events in Palestine, religious sentiment began to rise in Algeria. The country's political landscape shifted away from communism towards a more liberal economic approach. Despite this, Islam became the focal point of the government's official stance on religion. Today, Algeria's government no longer aligns with communism, and while it has adopted a more liberal economic outlook. It has adopted an official policy supporting Islam, making it the state religion. There's an institutionalization of Islam within the country.

> The phrase "events in Palestine" likely refers to various political and social developments occurring in the region of Palestine during the 1970s, which could have had an impact on Algerian society. These events could include conflicts between Palestinians and Israelis, the rise of Palestinian nationalist movements, the Arab-Israeli conflicts, and the broader Arab-Israeli peace process. Such events may have stirred up religious and political sentiments across the Arab world, including in Algeria, potentially contributing to the growing religious fervor mentioned in the context of Algeria's evolving political landscape during that time.

In Morocco, the political and religious landscapes are intertwined due to the monarchy. The king holds dual roles as head of state and commander of the faithful, tracing lineage back to the family of prophets. This means that religious matters have always intersected with politics because the king is not only the political leader but also the religious authority. Despite Islam being the state religion and the king's dual role, Morocco has demonstrated a liberal approach, particularly in protecting the religious rights of minorities like Christians and Jews. This means that while Islam holds a significant position in Moroccan society and some aspects of Muslim law are applied, there exists a system that safeguards the rights of minorities. For instance, churches and synagogues are allowed to exist, and individuals are free to practice their own religion without persecution. In contrast to some countries where there may be distinctions between Muslim and non-Muslim witnesses, in Morocco, a witness is a witness regardless of their religious affiliation. There is no preference or specification based on religion when it comes to legal matters, highlighting a more egalitarian approach in the country's legal system.

> A synagogue is a Jewish place of worship and community gathering. It serves as the central institution for Jewish religious and communal life. Synagogues are used for various purposes, including prayer services, Torah study, religious education, lifecycle events such as weddings and bar/bat mitzvahs, and communal gatherings.
>
> The layout and design of synagogues can vary widely depending on cultural and architectural traditions, as well as the size and needs of the local Jewish community. However, many synagogues feature a sanctuary (or main prayer hall), where congregants gather for worship services, as well as additional spaces for study, socializing, and administrative functions.
>
> In addition to its religious functions, the synagogue often serves as a hub for social, cultural, and educational activities within the Jewish community. It plays a central role in preserving Jewish identity, fostering connections among community members, and promoting the values and traditions of Judaism.

In Tunisia, the approach has been quite distinct as well. When Bourguiba, the leader of independence, became president, he brought with him a socialist ideology. Although not a communist, Bourguiba strongly advocated for socialist principles, drawing from his earlier affiliation with the French Socialist Party in the 1930s. He was particularly passionate about secularism, or laïcité. Despite being a predominantly Muslim country, Tunisia under Bourguiba aimed to uphold secular principles. While Bourguiba himself received a Muslim funeral upon his death, he stressed the importance of laïcité. Consequently, Tunisia experienced peaceful coexistence among its three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Unlike in some other Muslim-majority nations, the influence of Islamic law was relatively minimal in Tunisia. For instance, family law in Tunisia resembled practices found in Western countries rather than strictly adhering to Islamic principles. This reflects Tunisia's commitment to maintaining a balance between its Muslim heritage and secular governance.

> Habib Bourguiba was a prominent Tunisian statesman who played a pivotal role in the country's struggle for independence from French colonial rule and subsequently served as the first President of Tunisia. Bourguiba was a key figure in shaping modern Tunisia, advocating for secularism, women's rights, and social reforms. He led Tunisia to independence in 1956 and implemented progressive policies aimed at modernizing the country's economy and society. Bourguiba's presidency spanned over three decades until he was ousted in 1987. Despite his controversial later years in power, Bourguiba is widely regarded as the architect of Tunisia's independence and modernization.

#### Principles of interpretation and application

Once again, looking at these examples, it's evident that Islamic law offers a wide spectrum of interpretations, ranging from strict to liberal. This diversity can sometimes be challenging to grasp when discussing Islamic law because while some perceive it as rigid and definitive, there are varying applications, including some quite liberal ones. What's intriguing about this legal system is that when a rule is clear, believers are expected to adhere to it. However, if a rule is ambiguous, interpretation is permitted by religious scholars, known as "doctors" of the faith.

These "doctors" are not only religious figures but also legal experts, as they are well-versed in Islamic law. However, it's important to note that there isn't absolute freedom in interpretation. An interpretation is deemed acceptable only if it aligns with the consensus of other scholars and doesn't alter the fundamental principles of the law. In essence, interpretations are meant to clarify unclear rules rather than redefine them. This ensures a degree of consistency and stability within the framework of Islamic law.

As a result, different verses within Islamic scripture can have numerous interpretations, as scholars, or "doctors," offer their explanations. Even today, new interpretations continue to emerge. An interesting example of this adaptability is the interpretation devised by scholars to address the issue of Muslim astronauts praying in space. Traditionally, Muslims pray facing the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, typically indicated by markers in mosques or on rooftops. However, in space, where there's no fixed direction due to the orbiting of Earth, determining the qibla (the direction of Mecca) becomes challenging. Scholars have tackled this dilemma by providing guidance on how Muslim astronauts can fulfill their obligation of praying five times a day while in orbit. This example highlights the flexibility of Islamic jurisprudence, which can accommodate modern challenges while remaining rooted in traditional principles. Despite facing unique circumstances, such as being in space, Muslims can still adhere to their religious practices through innovative interpretations.

> The Kaaba is a cuboid-shaped building located in the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is considered the holiest site in Islam and is revered by Muslims worldwide. Muslims face the Kaaba when performing their prayers, and this direction is known as the qibla. The qibla represents the direction that Muslims must face during their daily prayers, symbolizing unity and the focal point of worship in Islam.

When it comes to applying Islamic rules, believers encounter various scenarios that dictate their actions. In essence, there's a step-by-step system outlining the believer's obligations.

- Firstly, there are situations where the law imposes an **obligation**, either positively or negatively. Here, the believer must adhere to what the law dictates without any choice in the matter.

- Secondly, there are **recommendations**. Although the text suggests a particular behavior, believers have the option to interpret the law themselves. They are encouraged to follow the recommendation, but it's not mandatory.

- Next, we have **prohibitions**, which are akin to obligations but in reverse. These actions are strictly forbidden by the law, leaving believers with no choice but to abstain. An example of this is the prohibition against consuming alcohol.

- Moving on, there are actions categorized as "**not recommended**." While technically discouraged, believers have some leeway to interpret and decide for themselves. For instance, while it's recommended to have a maximum of four wives, having more is not strictly prohibited. Instead, it's left to the believer's discretion, considering their ability to care for multiple spouses.

- Lastly, there's **tolerance**. Although an action may be forbidden under normal circumstances, certain situations might warrant leniency. This allows for flexibility in interpretation, considering specific circumstances.

When analyzing a case, legal scholars consider these five possibilities: obligation, recommendation, prohibition, not recommended, and tolerance. This comprehensive framework guides believers in understanding and applying Islamic law to different situations.

### Sunnah

The Sunnah refers to the traditions and practices of early Muslim communities, primarily in Arabia. It encompasses the Hadith, which are interpretations and anecdotes about the Prophet Muhammad's actions and sayings. Essentially, the Sunnah serves as a living tradition of Islam's early legal schools.

This tradition consists of prescriptions given by the Prophet or his successors concerning both religious and state matters. It's like a set of customs that guide behavior, derived from the Quran's principles applied in real-life situations by the Prophet and his family.

In essence, the Quran provides theoretical principles, while the Sunnah offers practical applications to concrete scenarios. For example, while the Quran stipulates that Muslims must pray five times a day, the Sunnah provides guidance on how to reconcile this obligation with daily life circumstances.

In non-Muslim countries or situations where immediate prayer isn't feasible, such as during surgery, the Sunnah offers interpretations and solutions. This could include praying before or after the scheduled time or engaging in personal communication with God instead of formal prayer.

> In Islam, it is obligatory for Muslims to perform five daily prayers known as Salah or Salat. These prayers are performed at specific times throughout the day, starting before sunrise and continuing until late evening. The five daily prayers are Fajr (pre-dawn), Dhuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (just after sunset), and Isha (night). These prayers are considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam and are a fundamental practice for Muslims to maintain a connection with Allah (God) and fulfill their religious duties.

In legal terms, the Sunnah operates similarly to the rule of precedent in common law systems. When faced with a contemporary issue, scholars refer to previous cases and their solutions. They may either directly apply a similar solution or adapt it to fit the current circumstances through interpretation. This process ensures continuity and relevance in addressing new challenges within Islamic jurisprudence.

### Ijma

"Ijma" essentially means consensus. It refers to the unanimous agreement among scholars or interpreters on a particular rule or interpretation within Islamic jurisprudence. This unanimity gives Ijma significant weight, as it indicates a widely accepted understanding or ruling.

It's important to note that Ijma deals with interpretations developed after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. While the Sunnah comprises the practices and teachings of the Prophet during his lifetime, Ijma involves interpretations made by his successors. This places it lower in the hierarchy of Islamic sources compared to the Quran and Sunnah.

The Quran holds the highest authority as it is believed to be directly revealed by God. The Sunnah, which consists of the Prophet's interpretations and teachings, is also highly regarded because it stems from divine revelation. Ijma, while significant due to its consensus among scholars, is not considered on par with the Quran and Sunnah in terms of authority.

In resolving legal or religious matters, scholars often refer to all three sources. However, in cases of contradiction between them, priority is given to the Quran and Sunnah over Ijma. This ensures adherence to the fundamental principles laid out in divine revelation while still acknowledging the importance of scholarly consensus. Thus, while Ijma is a valuable source of guidance, it must be scrutinized in light of the Quran and Sunnah to ensure its correctness.

### Qiyas

Qiyas, meaning analogy, is a method of analysis within Islamic law where comparisons are drawn between texts and interpretations to derive rulings. Let's illustrate this with an example: the question of whether Muslims can drink beer.

First, we examine the text, which clearly prohibits the consumption of alcohol for Muslims. The rationale behind this prohibition is to prevent intoxication, as losing control goes against the principles of self-discipline and adherence to religious obligations.

Now, let's apply Qiyas. Beer typically contains alcohol, so it falls under the general prohibition of alcoholic beverages. However, there are non-alcoholic beers available, often called Islamic beer. These beverages lack alcohol and are permissible for Muslims to drink. This analysis is based on the principle that what's prohibited is the consumption of alcohol, not beer itself.

> "Islamic beer" is a term that doesn't have a specific meaning within Islamic law or culture. Generally, beer, which contains alcohol, is considered haram (forbidden) in Islam because the consumption of alcohol is prohibited according to Islamic teachings. However, some companies or individuals may use the term "Islamic beer" to refer to non-alcoholic or alcohol-free beer, which is made to resemble traditional beer but without the presence of alcohol. This type of beverage may be marketed towards Muslim consumers who wish to enjoy the taste of beer without violating Islamic dietary restrictions. Nonetheless, opinions on the permissibility of consuming non-alcoholic beer vary among Islamic scholars and communities.

Qiyas involves reflecting on the purpose and context of the text to understand its underlying reasons. It's not just about blindly applying rules but understanding the principles behind them.

This method isn't limited to dietary matters. It also applies to other aspects of Islamic law, like fasting during Ramadan. For instance, children below a certain age aren't required to fast, and exceptions are made for the sick or pregnant women. These exceptions are justified based on preserving health or protecting life.

> In Islam, there are certain exemptions from fasting during Ramadan, which include:
>
> 1. Children who have not reached puberty are not obligated to fast.
> 2. Those who are mentally ill or mentally incapacitated are exempt.
> 3. People who are traveling long distances, especially if it would be excessively burdensome to fast while traveling.
> 4. Pregnant or nursing women, if fasting would endanger their health or the health of their child.
> 5. Women who are menstruating or experiencing postpartum bleeding are exempt from fasting until they are no longer in this state.
> 6. Those who are elderly or chronically ill and for whom fasting would be excessively difficult or harmful.
>
> It's important to note that individuals who are exempt from fasting during Ramadan are often expected to make up for missed fasts at a later time or to provide compensation, such as feeding a needy person for each day missed.

In essence, Qiyas allows for reasoned interpretations and exceptions, ensuring that Islamic law remains adaptable to various circumstances through analogy and thoughtful analysis.

## Different branches of law

### Institutional and constitutional law

#### Sharia

In the majority of Muslim countries, public, institutional, and constitutional law often refer to Sharia as a source, or even the main source, of law. The situation varies from country to country. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, the Quran serves as the constitution. This implies that public law in Saudi Arabia is structured according to the principles originating from the Quran.

*In Saudi Arabia, there exists a distinctive system due to its monarchy. Unlike some monarchies where kingship is hereditary, in Saudi Arabia, succession to the throne follows a system based on lineage. When a king passes away, his successor is not necessarily his eldest son but rather his brother. In a scenario where there are multiple brothers, all are potential successors to the throne. There is a family council within the royal family tasked with determining the succession upon the king's demise. Typically, the succeeding brother of the deceased king assumes the throne, but exceptions may occur, for example, if a brother is deemed unfit due to mental health issues or if there are conflicts within the royal family. Therefore, succession often proceeds from brother to brother until the last brother, where a decision is made collectively considering various factors.*

> In Saudi Arabia, the rule of inheritance of the throne follows a specific system known as "agnatic seniority," which means that the throne passes from one male member of the ruling family to another based on seniority among the descendants of the founding king, King Abdulaziz Al Saud.
>
> The basic principles of succession in Saudi Arabia are as follows:
>
> 1. **Primogeniture**: The throne passes from the reigning king to his eldest living son, provided he is deemed fit to rule by the Allegiance Council and other senior members of the royal family.
>
> 2. **Seniority**: If the eldest son is unable or unfit to rule, the throne passes to the next eldest son who is deemed fit. If there are no eligible sons, the throne passes to the eldest living brother of the king, and then to the next eldest brother, and so on, based on seniority.
>
> 3. **Allegiance Council**: The Allegiance Council is responsible for determining the eligibility of candidates for the throne and confirming the choice of the king's successor. It is composed of senior members of the Al Saud family.
>
> 4. **Consultation and Consensus**: The process of succession involves consultation and consensus-building among members of the royal family to ensure stability and continuity in leadership.
>
> 5. **Male-Line Descendants**: In Saudi Arabia, only male-line descendants of King Abdulaziz Al Saud are eligible to inherit the throne. Female members of the royal family do not have succession rights to the throne.
>
> Overall, the succession system in Saudi Arabia is designed to maintain stability and continuity within the ruling Al Saud family while adhering to the principles of Islamic law and tradition.

In Saudi Arabia, customs play a significant role in addressing succession matters alongside formal procedures. However, it's important to note that this is a unique case. In most Muslim countries, there is a written system. Nevertheless, the preamble of their constitutions typically acknowledges Islam in some form. This signifies that Islam is the foundational source of their legal system. Consequently, legislators and executive authorities must draw inspiration from Islamic tradition and law when drafting and implementing legislation.

> The Quran provides guidelines on inheritance, which are known as "Islamic inheritance laws" or "Quranic inheritance laws." These laws dictate how a deceased person's estate should be distributed among their heirs. The Quran outlines specific shares for different relatives, ensuring fair and just distribution of wealth within the family.
>
> Some key principles of Islamic inheritance laws include:
>
> 1. **Prescribed Shares**: The Quran prescribes fixed shares for certain heirs, such as spouses, parents, children, and siblings. These shares are expressed as fractions or percentages of the deceased's estate.
>
> 2. **Automatic Succession**: Islamic inheritance laws specify automatic succession, meaning that heirs are entitled to their prescribed shares of the estate without the need for a will or testamentary document.
>
> 3. **Priority of Heirs**: Certain relatives have priority over others in inheritance. For example, spouses and children are given priority over more distant relatives like siblings or cousins.
>
> 4. **Prohibited Heirs**: There are categories of heirs who are prohibited from inheriting, such as non-Muslims, murderers of the deceased, or those who intentionally abandon Islam.
>
> 5. **Optional Bequests**: While the Quranic inheritance laws prescribe fixed shares for certain heirs, there is also provision for optional bequests (wasiyah) of up to one-third of the estate. This allows the deceased to allocate a portion of their wealth to individuals or causes outside the prescribed heirs.
>
> These inheritance laws are intended to ensure fairness and justice in the distribution of wealth and property among family members, as well as to uphold the rights of heirs as prescribed in Islamic jurisprudence.

#### International treaties

Sometimes it is asserted that Islam is not only a source but the main source of law. This means that even if the Constitution recognizes several other sources, such as international treaties, Islam remains the primary inspiration for judges, legislators, and members of the executive office. Nowadays, due to globalization, Muslim countries operate similarly to other nations worldwide. This means there is recognition of international sources of law as well.

After the mention of the Quran or Islamic law, there can also be references to specific international treaties. For example, there may be a reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 within the United Nations system. Additionally, there may be references to other global texts, such as the Treaty of New York regarding the protection of children or texts related to environmental protection and human rights.

Sometimes, there may be references to specific international texts that provide protections, but these are not universal. They apply to several territories but are not universally applicable. For instance, the European Declaration of Human Rights is international because multiple states are involved, yet it is not universal as it applies only to the European continent and the countries that are members of the Council of Europe.

*The Universal Declaration of Human Rights:*

> The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948. It is a milestone document that proclaims the inalienable rights which everyone is inherently entitled to as a human being regardless of race, color, religion, sex, language, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status. The UDHR consists of 30 articles outlining a comprehensive set of fundamental human rights, including civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights.
>
> Some key provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights include:
>
> 1. The right to life, liberty, and security of person (Article 3)
> 2. The prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 4)
> 3. The right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (Article 18)
> 4. The right to freedom of opinion and expression (Article 19)
> 5. The right to work, to free choice of employment, and to just and favorable conditions of work (Article 23)
> 6. The right to education (Article 26)
> 7. The right to participate in government and to equal access to public service (Article 21)
>
> The UDHR serves as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations and has been translated into over 500 languages. It has inspired the development of numerous international human rights treaties and conventions, as well as national constitutions and laws, contributing to the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide.

*The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:*

> The Treaty of New York refers to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1989, in New York City. The CRC is a comprehensive international treaty that sets out the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights of children.
>
> Key provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child include:
>
> 1. The right to life, survival, and development (Article 6)
> 2. The right to a name and nationality, and to preserve their identity (Article 7)
> 3. The right to freedom of expression (Article 13)
> 4. The right to education (Article 28)
> 5. The right to health care (Article 24)
> 6. The right to protection from all forms of violence, abuse, neglect, and exploitation (Article 19)
> 7. The right to participate in decisions affecting them (Article 12)
>
> The Convention also establishes mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing children's rights, including the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which reviews reports submitted by countries on their implementation of the CRC.
>
> The Treaty of New York, or the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, with 196 countries having ratified or acceded to it. It represents a landmark commitment by the international community to promote and protect the rights of children worldwide.

Similarly, in Islamic countries, there are instances where states have decided to sign the Muslim Declaration of Human Rights. This declaration includes articles that align with ideas found in other international texts but also incorporates specific aspects. For instance, the Muslim Declaration of Human Rights acknowledges the specificity of the Muslim religion.

> The Muslim Declaration of Human Rights (MDHR) is a document that outlines the human rights principles from an Islamic perspective. It was drafted in 1981 by the Islamic Council of Europe and endorsed by the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers. The MDHR seeks to articulate human rights standards that are consistent with Islamic teachings and values while also affirming the universality of human rights principles.
>
> Key features of the Muslim Declaration of Human Rights include:
>
> 1. Recognition of the inherent dignity and equal rights of all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender.
> 2. Emphasis on the importance of justice, equality, and non-discrimination in accordance with Islamic principles.
> 3. Protection of religious freedom and the right to practice one's faith without coercion or discrimination.
> 4. Support for social justice, including the rights to education, work, and a decent standard of living.
> 5. Promotion of peace, tolerance, and mutual respect among individuals and communities.
>
> The Muslim Declaration of Human Rights aims to provide a framework for understanding human rights from an Islamic perspective and to contribute to the dialogue on human rights within the Muslim world and globally. While not legally binding like international human rights treaties, the MDHR serves as an important statement of principles and values within the Islamic community.

While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the freedom of religion and the right to believe or not believe in religion, the international Muslim declaration recognizes the specificity of Islam. This means that while states recognize the existence of different religions, this particular declaration highlights the unique aspects of the Islamic religion among its adherents.

This nuanced approach differs from other international declarations, where the emphasis is on freedom of opinion and religion, ensuring individuals have the right to express various opinions, including religious beliefs. However, in the international Muslim declaration of human rights, there is a focus on protecting the Muslim faith. Thus, the aim is not just to protect religion generally but to specifically safeguard the rights of those practicing Islam.

#### Political principles

In Islamic constitutional law, the text of the Constitution can reference various political principles, such as the parliamentary system, separation of powers, representative system, the principle of democracy, and the role of parliament. However, these principles may be interpreted and applied differently across different countries. For instance, in Bahrain, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, the political organization and principles of the state are largely influenced by Sharia law and the Quran. This means that Islamic principles directly shape many branches of law and their application in daily life. For example, family law in these countries is heavily influenced by Islamic legal principles concerning matters such as the status of women and rules of filiation.

In these nations, traditional Islamic law dictates that paternity is established through marriage, with children considered part of the father's family lineage. Consequently, inheritance laws often favor male heirs over females. Legal rights, including inheritance, are typically conferred based on patrilineal descent. Therefore, legal disputes may arise regarding the rights of female heirs, especially in cases where there are no male offspring, as inheritance customs often prioritize male relatives.

> 1. **Sons and Daughters**:
>    - Sons typically receive double the share of daughters. For example, if a deceased individual leaves behind both sons and daughters, each son may inherit twice the share of each daughter.
>    - If there are only daughters and no sons, they collectively inherit two-thirds of the estate.
>    - If there are only sons and no daughters, they inherit the entire estate.
>
> 2. **Parents**:
>    - Both the father and mother are entitled to inherit from their deceased child's estate.
>    - The father usually receives twice the share of the mother. If the deceased individual has both parents, the father would inherit twice the share of the mother.
>
> 3. **Spouse**:
>    - The surviving spouse is entitled to inherit a portion of the estate, which varies depending on the presence of other heirs.
>    - If the deceased individual leaves behind children, the spouse's share is typically determined based on the number of children. For example, if there are children, the spouse may inherit one-eighth of the estate if there is one child and one-fourth if there are multiple children.
>    - If there are no children, the spouse's share may increase, potentially up to one-half or more of the estate.
>
> 4. **Siblings**:
>    - In the absence of children, parents, or spouses, siblings may inherit from the estate.
>    - Brothers typically receive double the share of sisters. If there are both brothers and sisters, the brothers collectively inherit twice the share of the sisters.
>
> 5. **Grandparents and More Distant Relatives**:
>    - If there are no immediate family members (children, parents, spouse, siblings), more distant relatives may inherit from the estate, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.
>    - The shares for more distant relatives are determined based on their relationship to the deceased individual and the specific rules of inheritance outlined in Sharia law.
>
> It's important to note that the distribution of inheritance under Sharia law is subject to interpretation by Islamic jurists and may vary based on cultural and regional practices. Additionally, individuals may have the option to deviate from the default rules of inheritance through estate planning mechanisms such as wills, as long as they adhere to the principles of Sharia law.

In countries like Saudi Arabia, where strict adherence to traditional Islamic law is prevalent, families often negotiate marriage contracts to safeguard the rights of wives in the event of widowhood. Without such contracts, widows may face legal and social challenges due to the patriarchal nature of inheritance laws. In some cases, daughters may be excluded from inheritance altogether, receiving their share of inheritance only upon marriage. Consequently, marriage contracts may include provisions ensuring daughters receive inheritance rights irrespective of their marital status.

> In some Muslim cultures, it is common for families to negotiate and sign marriage contracts, known as "nikah" contracts, on behalf of the bride and groom before the wedding. These contracts outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties within the marriage and may cover various aspects of married life, such as financial matters, division of household duties, and dispute resolution mechanisms.
>
> The contents of these marriage contracts can vary widely depending on cultural and religious traditions, as well as legal requirements in the country where the marriage takes place. In some cases, the contract may include provisions related to the bride's dowry (mahr), inheritance rights, and other important aspects of the marriage.
>
> While marriage contracts are more commonly associated with Islamic marriages, they are not universally practiced in all Muslim communities, and their use may depend on factors such as cultural customs, family preferences, and legal requirements. Additionally, the extent to which women are involved in the negotiation and signing of marriage contracts can vary, with some contracts being negotiated primarily between families and others involving input from the bride and groom themselves.

However, in countries such as Tunisia and Morocco, the Constitution may draw inspiration from the Quran and Sharia, but the family law is not solely governed by Islamic principles. Instead, legislation enacted by parliament incorporates both Islamic principles and modern legal norms, promoting greater gender equality in matters of inheritance and family law. This shift reflects a departure from strict adherence to traditional Islamic law and a move towards a legal framework that balances Islamic values with principles of equality and justice.

### The notion of "fatwa"

Indeed, the term "fatwa" gained widespread recognition due to the highly publicized case involving Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses." Salman Rushdie, a British author of Pakistani descent, penned this novel approximately 40 to 45 years ago. In "The Satanic Verses," Rushdie presents a fictional narrative where he imagines that Muhammad experienced erotic dreams during his lifetime. Rushdie suggests that Muhammad wrote verses describing these dreams, which were later excluded from the official Quran due to their perceived satanic nature. This exclusion led Rushdie to title his novel "The Satanic Verses," referring to these verses that were deemed satanic and omitted from the Quran.

> The Satanic Verses consists of a frame narrative, using elements of magical realism, interlaced with a series of sub-plots that are narrated as dream visions experienced by one of the protagonists. The frame narrative, like many other stories by Rushdie, involves Indian expatriates in contemporary England. The two protagonists, Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha, are both actors of Indian Muslim background. Farishta is a Bollywood superstar who specializes in playing Hindu deities. Chamcha is an emigrant who has broken with his Indian identity and works as a voiceover artist in England.
>
> At the beginning of the novel, both are trapped in a plane hijacked by Sikh separatists, flying from India to Britain. The plane explodes over the English Channel, but the two are magically saved. In a miraculous transformation, Farishta takes on the personality of the archangel Gabriel, and Chamcha takes on that of the devil. Chamcha is arrested and passes through an ordeal of police abuse as a suspected illegal immigrant.
>
> Both characters struggle to piece their lives back together. Farishta seeks and finds his lost love, the English mountaineer Allie Cone, but their relationship is overshadowed by his mental illness. Chamcha, having miraculously regained his human shape, wants to take revenge on Farishta for having forsaken him after their common fall from the hijacked plane. He does so by fostering Farishta's pathological jealousy and paranoid schizophrenia, thus destroying his relationship with Allie. In another moment of crisis, Farishta realizes what Chamcha has done, initially going on a campaign of arson through London, before deciding to forgive Chamcha and rescuing him from a building he's set ablaze.
>
> Both return to India. Farishta throws Allie off a high rise in another outbreak of jealousy and then dies by suicide. Chamcha, who has found not only forgiveness from Farishta but also reconciliation with his estranged father and his own Indian identity, decides to remain in India.

When saying "satanic," it means that Rushdie's intention was to challenge the perception of Islam as rigid and conservative, advocating for a more open-minded interpretation of the religion. However, it's crucial to understand that Rushdie is not a theologian but a novelist expressing his views on Islam through his literary work.

Salman Rushdie hails from a Muslim background but has spent the majority of his life in Western countries, where he does not actively practice his religion. It's essential to note that his book is a work of fiction, not a scholarly or scientific treatise on religion. Rushdie uses his novel to argue that Islam has become excessively conservative and strict, advocating for a more liberal interpretation of its principles. However, this perspective was highly controversial, particularly among conservative Muslims.

The publication of "The Satanic Verses" ignited widespread outrage, particularly from Ayatollah Khomeini, who issued a fatwa against Rushdie. Prior to this incident, the term "fatwa" was not widely recognized in Western countries, as it was primarily used within Muslim communities and nations. However, Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Rushdie brought this term into mainstream Western discourse.

> "In the name of God the Almighty. We belong to God and to Him we shall return.
>
> I would like to inform all the intrepid Muslims in the world that the author of the book entitled The Satanic Verses—which has been compiled, printed, and published in opposition to Islam, the Prophet, and the Qur’an, and those who had any connection with it or helped to publish it—have been sentenced to death. I call on all zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever they may be found, so that no one will dare to insult the Islamic sanctities. Whoever is killed in this cause will be a martyr, God willing. Additionally, if anyone has access to the author of the book but fails to execute him, he will be sentenced to death as well."

Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa called for Rushdie's execution, citing offenses against the Prophet Muhammad and Islam. Khomeini declared that any Muslim worldwide had a duty to kill Rushdie for insulting Islam and the Prophet. This fatwa sparked an international outcry and led to Rushdie living under constant police protection for over 35 years, moving from London to New York. He was targeted in an assassination attempt two or three years ago, resulting in severe physical injuries. Fortunately, he is still alive and continues to write.

> Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie was issued in 1989. Despite a conciliatory statement by Iran in 1998, and Rushdie's declaration that he would stop living in hiding, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported in 2006 that the fatwa would remain in place permanently since fatawa can only be rescinded by the person who first issued them, and Khomeini had since died.

Despite the controversy surrounding the novel, many readers found it lacking in literary merit. However, its significance as a symbol of free speech and expression has cemented its place as a landmark work in contemporary literature. Thus, "The Satanic Verses" has become emblematic of the struggle for freedom of expression, even though its literary quality may be subject to debate. This case has also influenced Western perceptions of the term "fatwa," often associating it with the death penalty. In fact, fatwas are judgments given by Islamic scholars, not necessarily global or with criminal aspects.
