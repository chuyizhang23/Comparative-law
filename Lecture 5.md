## Sources of Islamic laws

### Quran

The Quran, which means "recitation," contains over 600 verses with legal implications, serving as the basis for statutory law in Islamic legal systems. Islamic law dictates that every human action in daily life must strictly adhere to God's law as outlined in the Quran. Believers consider the Quran as the voice of God, directly revealed through the testimony of faith. Consequently, followers are required to strictly adhere to Islamic law, which is viewed as definitive and immutable.

> The testimony of faith, known as the Shahada in Islam, is a declaration affirming the central belief in the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad. It is recited by Muslims as a public declaration of their faith and consists of two parts:
>
> 1. "La ilaha illallah" (There is no god but Allah): This affirms the belief in the absolute oneness of God, emphasizing that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.
>
> 2. "Muhammadun rasulullah" (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah): This acknowledges Muhammad as the final prophet and messenger of Allah, through whom the Quran was revealed.
>
> The Shahada is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is recited by Muslims in various religious rituals and daily prayers.

#### Different interpretations of Islamic law

Islamic law is not very adaptable to modern legal systems because the Quran is not easily changed, except in some cases where interpretations by scholars allow for flexibility. As a result, adherence to Islamic law is often strict. It's important to note that the application of Islamic law varies significantly between different countries, with some adopting more liberal interpretations and applications of the text.

For example, in France, there are three interpretations regarding the wearing of the veil. Some texts suggest that women should be cautious about their attire, while others advocate for wearing a veil. Additionally, historical customs reveal instances where non-Muslim women wore veils. This practice traces back to many civilizations that sought to control women by concealing their hair.

Considering the varying opinions on wearing veils, the Minister of Home Affairs, who also oversees religious affairs in France, conducted an official visit to Egypt. During this visit, he met with esteemed scholars at the renowned Islamic university in Cairo to inquire about the official stance on wearing veils. These scholars, being from one of the most prestigious Muslim universities globally, are considered authoritative voices on the matter. They expressed that Muslim women are obliged to wear the veil in Muslim-majority countries, while Muslims residing in non-Muslim countries should adhere to local customs. Therefore, in Western countries, Muslim women can wear veils unless prohibited by local laws. For instance, in France, wearing veils under certain circumstances is forbidden. For example, when you are in college or you are a civil servant during service, individuals must comply with these regulations. That's one point of view.

You have certain points of view given by liberal Muslim muftis, and one of them was very famous. Some years ago, he was the mufti of a big mosque in Marseille. This Imam is considered a leader of liberal interpretations of Islam in Western countries. He stated that Muslims living in Western countries must adapt their faith to the civil law of the country where they reside. We have to carefully consider the obligations that believers must absolutely follow and determine which rules can be adapted based on the local context. Wearing a veil is not a religious command; it is considered a tradition that existed in ancient Arabia during the time of the Prophet. He emphasized that all interpretations of Islamic law are linked to geographical criteria. These rules were established in societies that mandated veiling for women. Therefore, living in Western countries, there is absolutely no obligation for women to wear a veil. The fundamental practices of the Muslim religion do not dictate the wearing of a veil.

> A mufti is an Islamic scholar who is qualified to interpret Islamic law (Sharia) and issue legal opinions (fatwas) on specific religious matters. These legal opinions often address questions related to religious practices, social issues, ethics, and personal conduct in accordance with Islamic principles. Muftis play an important role in providing guidance to Muslims on how to apply Islamic teachings to their daily lives.
>
> An Imam is an Islamic leadership position, often the worship leader of a mosque and the community. In Sunni Islam, the Imam leads the prayers; in Shia Islam, the Imam leads the community both politically and religiously. The term can also refer more broadly to a knowledgeable person who leads prayers, teaches Islam, and serves as a spiritual guide.

And you have a third interpretation given by scholars, particularly those in Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan, countries that practice very strict Islam. In these states, scholars say it is written in the Quran and in the tradition that Muslim women have to wear a veil, making it a legal and religious obligation for them to do so. For example, in Saudi Arabia, there is a distinction between local women, who are Muslim and must wear a veil, and foreigners living in the country, who are not obliged to wear one. This distinction is maintained. However, this distinction does not apply in Iran. In Iran, all women, whether Muslim or not, Iranian or not Iranian, must wear a veil when they are outside. It is considered a legal offense not to wear a veil or to wear one without covering the hair.

With this example, you can see that for the same question, we have different answers provided by various countries and schools of Islamic law. And so it means that, on the one hand, we can say that, yes, Islamic law is definitive and immutable; it is definitively written and cannot be changed, but on the other hand, we can see that we can have the same text with different interpretations; some interpretations can be very conservative, others can be liberal. In France, it’s a very old and hot debate.

*There are many countries where Muslim law is obligatory, alongside obligations stemming from other traditions. For example, legal traditions inherited from the colonial period may also coexist. In such cases, Muslim principles may be applied within a broader legal framework that includes elements from civil law and other legal systems.*

#### Different societies in the Islamic world

In the 1970s, Afghanistan was considered one of the most liberal countries in the Islamic world. For instance, women had the freedom to pursue education at universities without facing discrimination. Additionally, the fashion and lifestyle in urban areas resembled that of Europe or California. This illustrates that freedoms are not always permanent, and sometimes religious beliefs can challenge liberties that are supposed to be protected by law or constitution.

The shift in Afghanistan's social dynamics can be partly attributed to the Soviet invasion in the 1970s. The Soviet Union supported the Communist Party, which had a strict stance against religious freedom. Consequently, resistance against the Soviet occupation also became a resurgence of religious identity for many Afghans. This phenomenon was not unique to Afghanistan; similar dynamics were observed in Iran.

Both Afghanistan and Iran experienced a coexistence of liberal urban centers and conservative rural areas. However, when power shifted in urban areas, there was a widespread embrace of religious sentiments throughout society. In Iran, the Shah aimed to modernize the country economically and administratively while maintaining a conservative political system. The revolutions in both countries were, paradoxically, conservative in nature: in Afghanistan, aimed against the Soviet Union, and in Iran, against Western values.

> In Iran, the term "Shah" historically refers to the title of the monarch, equivalent to a king or emperor. Before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iran was ruled by a Shah, specifically Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. However, after the revolution, Iran became an Islamic Republic, and the title of Shah was abolished in favor of a system of governance led by a Supreme Leader and elected officials.

Before these revolutions, Islam was more of a cultural expression for many Iranians, akin to how Christmas may be celebrated in Western countries—some as a religious belief, others as tradition, and some purely commercially. Similarly, in Iran, religious practices were diverse, with many urban dwellers engaging in cultural rather than strictly religious expressions of faith.

Algeria gained independence in 1962, and in the initial years post-independence, it leaned towards a communist ideology. Consequently, the government's stance on religion was ambiguous. Some officials echoed Karl Marx's view that religion serves as an opiate for the masses, implying that it should be downplayed. This ambivalence towards religion was evident as Christians, and Jews, predominantly French citizens, left Algeria around 1962, resulting in a predominantly Muslim population. During the 1970s, possibly influenced by events in Palestine, religious sentiment began to rise in Algeria. The country's political landscape shifted away from communism towards a more liberal economic approach. Despite this, Islam became the focal point of the government's official stance on religion. Today, Algeria's government no longer aligns with communism, and while it has adopted a more liberal economic outlook. It has adopted an official policy supporting Islam, making it the state religion. There's an institutionalization of Islam within the country.

> The phrase "events in Palestine" likely refers to various political and social developments occurring in the region of Palestine during the 1970s, which could have had an impact on Algerian society. These events could include conflicts between Palestinians and Israelis, the rise of Palestinian nationalist movements, the Arab-Israeli conflicts, and the broader Arab-Israeli peace process. Such events may have stirred up religious and political sentiments across the Arab world, including in Algeria, potentially contributing to the growing religious fervor mentioned in the context of Algeria's evolving political landscape during that time.

In Morocco, the political and religious landscapes are intertwined due to the monarchy. The king holds dual roles as head of state and commander of the faithful, tracing lineage back to the family of prophets. This means that religious matters have always intersected with politics because the king is not only the political leader but also the religious authority. Despite Islam being the state religion and the king's dual role, Morocco has demonstrated a liberal approach, particularly in protecting the religious rights of minorities like Christians and Jews. This means that while Islam holds a significant position in Moroccan society and some aspects of Muslim law are applied, there exists a system that safeguards the rights of minorities. For instance, churches and synagogues are allowed to exist, and individuals are free to practice their own religion without persecution. In contrast to some countries where there may be distinctions between Muslim and non-Muslim witnesses, in Morocco, a witness is a witness regardless of their religious affiliation. There is no preference or specification based on religion when it comes to legal matters, highlighting a more egalitarian approach in the country's legal system.

> A synagogue is a Jewish place of worship and community gathering. It serves as the central institution for Jewish religious and communal life. Synagogues are used for various purposes, including prayer services, Torah study, religious education, lifecycle events such as weddings and bar/bat mitzvahs, and communal gatherings.
>
> The layout and design of synagogues can vary widely depending on cultural and architectural traditions, as well as the size and needs of the local Jewish community. However, many synagogues feature a sanctuary (or main prayer hall), where congregants gather for worship services, as well as additional spaces for study, socializing, and administrative functions.
>
> In addition to its religious functions, the synagogue often serves as a hub for social, cultural, and educational activities within the Jewish community. It plays a central role in preserving Jewish identity, fostering connections among community members, and promoting the values and traditions of Judaism.

In Tunisia, the approach has been quite distinct as well. When Bourguiba, the leader of independence, became president, he brought with him a socialist ideology. Although not a communist, Bourguiba strongly advocated for socialist principles, drawing from his earlier affiliation with the French Socialist Party in the 1930s. He was particularly passionate about secularism, or laïcité. Despite being a predominantly Muslim country, Tunisia under Bourguiba aimed to uphold secular principles. While Bourguiba himself received a Muslim funeral upon his death, he stressed the importance of laïcité. Consequently, Tunisia experienced peaceful coexistence among its three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Unlike in some other Muslim-majority nations, the influence of Islamic law was relatively minimal in Tunisia. For instance, family law in Tunisia resembled practices found in Western countries rather than strictly adhering to Islamic principles. This reflects Tunisia's commitment to maintaining a balance between its Muslim heritage and secular governance.

> Habib Bourguiba was a prominent Tunisian statesman who played a pivotal role in the country's struggle for independence from French colonial rule and subsequently served as the first President of Tunisia. Bourguiba was a key figure in shaping modern Tunisia, advocating for secularism, women's rights, and social reforms. He led Tunisia to independence in 1956 and implemented progressive policies aimed at modernizing the country's economy and society. Bourguiba's presidency spanned over three decades until he was ousted in 1987. Despite his controversial later years in power, Bourguiba is widely regarded as the architect of Tunisia's independence and modernization.

#### Principles of interpretation and application

Once again, looking at these examples, it's evident that Islamic law offers a wide spectrum of interpretations, ranging from strict to liberal. This diversity can sometimes be challenging to grasp when discussing Islamic law because while some perceive it as rigid and definitive, there are varying applications, including some quite liberal ones. What's intriguing about this legal system is that when a rule is clear, believers are expected to adhere to it. However, if a rule is ambiguous, interpretation is permitted by religious scholars, known as "doctors" of the faith.

These "doctors" are not only religious figures but also legal experts, as they are well-versed in Islamic law. However, it's important to note that there isn't absolute freedom in interpretation. An interpretation is deemed acceptable only if it aligns with the consensus of other scholars and doesn't alter the fundamental principles of the law. In essence, interpretations are meant to clarify unclear rules rather than redefine them. This ensures a degree of consistency and stability within the framework of Islamic law.

As a result, different verses within Islamic scripture can have numerous interpretations, as scholars, or "doctors," offer their explanations. Even today, new interpretations continue to emerge. An interesting example of this adaptability is the interpretation devised by scholars to address the issue of Muslim astronauts praying in space. Traditionally, Muslims pray facing the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, typically indicated by markers in mosques or on rooftops. However, in space, where there's no fixed direction due to the orbiting of Earth, determining the qibla (the direction of Mecca) becomes challenging. Scholars have tackled this dilemma by providing guidance on how Muslim astronauts can fulfill their obligation of praying five times a day while in orbit. This example highlights the flexibility of Islamic jurisprudence, which can accommodate modern challenges while remaining rooted in traditional principles. Despite facing unique circumstances, such as being in space, Muslims can still adhere to their religious practices through innovative interpretations.

> The Kaaba is a cuboid-shaped building located in the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is considered the holiest site in Islam and is revered by Muslims worldwide. Muslims face the Kaaba when performing their prayers, and this direction is known as the qibla. The qibla represents the direction that Muslims must face during their daily prayers, symbolizing unity and the focal point of worship in Islam.

When it comes to applying Islamic rules, believers encounter various scenarios that dictate their actions. In essence, there's a step-by-step system outlining the believer's obligations.

- Firstly, there are situations where the law imposes an **obligation**, either positively or negatively. Here, the believer must adhere to what the law dictates without any choice in the matter.

- Secondly, there are **recommendations**. Although the text suggests a particular behavior, believers have the option to interpret the law themselves. They are encouraged to follow the recommendation, but it's not mandatory.

- Next, we have **prohibitions**, which are akin to obligations but in reverse. These actions are strictly forbidden by the law, leaving believers with no choice but to abstain. An example of this is the prohibition against consuming alcohol.

- Moving on, there are actions categorized as "**not recommended**." While technically discouraged, believers have some leeway to interpret and decide for themselves. For instance, while it's recommended to have a maximum of four wives, having more is not strictly prohibited. Instead, it's left to the believer's discretion, considering their ability to care for multiple spouses.

- Lastly, there's **tolerance**. Although an action may be forbidden under normal circumstances, certain situations might warrant leniency. This allows for flexibility in interpretation, considering specific circumstances.

When analyzing a case, legal scholars consider these five possibilities: obligation, recommendation, prohibition, not recommended, and tolerance. This comprehensive framework guides believers in understanding and applying Islamic law to different situations.

### Sunnah

The Sunnah refers to the traditions and practices of early Muslim communities, primarily in Arabia. It encompasses the Hadith, which are interpretations and anecdotes about the Prophet Muhammad's actions and sayings. Essentially, the Sunnah serves as a living tradition of Islam's early legal schools.

This tradition consists of prescriptions given by the Prophet or his successors concerning both religious and state matters. It's like a set of customs that guide behavior, derived from the Quran's principles applied in real-life situations by the Prophet and his family.

In essence, the Quran provides theoretical principles, while the Sunnah offers practical applications to concrete scenarios. For example, while the Quran stipulates that Muslims must pray five times a day, the Sunnah provides guidance on how to reconcile this obligation with daily life circumstances.

In non-Muslim countries or situations where immediate prayer isn't feasible, such as during surgery, the Sunnah offers interpretations and solutions. This could include praying before or after the scheduled time or engaging in personal communication with God instead of formal prayer.

> In Islam, it is obligatory for Muslims to perform five daily prayers known as Salah or Salat. These prayers are performed at specific times throughout the day, starting before sunrise and continuing until late evening. The five daily prayers are Fajr (pre-dawn), Dhuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (just after sunset), and Isha (night). These prayers are considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam and are a fundamental practice for Muslims to maintain a connection with Allah (God) and fulfill their religious duties.

In legal terms, the Sunnah operates similarly to the rule of precedent in common law systems. When faced with a contemporary issue, scholars refer to previous cases and their solutions. They may either directly apply a similar solution or adapt it to fit the current circumstances through interpretation. This process ensures continuity and relevance in addressing new challenges within Islamic jurisprudence.

### Ijma

"Ijma" essentially means consensus. It refers to the unanimous agreement among scholars or interpreters on a particular rule or interpretation within Islamic jurisprudence. This unanimity gives Ijma significant weight, as it indicates a widely accepted understanding or ruling.

It's important to note that Ijma deals with interpretations developed after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. While the Sunnah comprises the practices and teachings of the Prophet during his lifetime, Ijma involves interpretations made by his successors. This places it lower in the hierarchy of Islamic sources compared to the Quran and Sunnah.

The Quran holds the highest authority as it is believed to be directly revealed by God. The Sunnah, which consists of the Prophet's interpretations and teachings, is also highly regarded because it stems from divine revelation. Ijma, while significant due to its consensus among scholars, is not considered on par with the Quran and Sunnah in terms of authority.

In resolving legal or religious matters, scholars often refer to all three sources. However, in cases of contradiction between them, priority is given to the Quran and Sunnah over Ijma. This ensures adherence to the fundamental principles laid out in divine revelation while still acknowledging the importance of scholarly consensus. Thus, while Ijma is a valuable source of guidance, it must be scrutinized in light of the Quran and Sunnah to ensure its correctness.

### Qiyas

Qiyas, meaning analogy, is a method of analysis within Islamic law where comparisons are drawn between texts and interpretations to derive rulings. Let's illustrate this with an example: the question of whether Muslims can drink beer. 

First, we examine the text, which clearly prohibits the consumption of alcohol for Muslims. The rationale behind this prohibition is to prevent intoxication, as losing control goes against the principles of self-discipline and adherence to religious obligations. 

Now, let's apply Qiyas. Beer typically contains alcohol, so it falls under the general prohibition of alcoholic beverages. However, there are non-alcoholic beers available, often called Islamic beer. These beverages lack alcohol and are permissible for Muslims to drink. This analysis is based on the principle that what's prohibited is the consumption of alcohol, not beer itself.

> "Islamic beer" is a term that doesn't have a specific meaning within Islamic law or culture. Generally, beer, which contains alcohol, is considered haram (forbidden) in Islam because the consumption of alcohol is prohibited according to Islamic teachings. However, some companies or individuals may use the term "Islamic beer" to refer to non-alcoholic or alcohol-free beer, which is made to resemble traditional beer but without the presence of alcohol. This type of beverage may be marketed towards Muslim consumers who wish to enjoy the taste of beer without violating Islamic dietary restrictions. Nonetheless, opinions on the permissibility of consuming non-alcoholic beer vary among Islamic scholars and communities.

Qiyas involves reflecting on the purpose and context of the text to understand its underlying reasons. It's not just about blindly applying rules but understanding the principles behind them.

This method isn't limited to dietary matters. It also applies to other aspects of Islamic law, like fasting during Ramadan. For instance, children below a certain age aren't required to fast, and exceptions are made for the sick or pregnant women. These exceptions are justified based on preserving health or protecting life.

> In Islam, there are certain exemptions from fasting during Ramadan, which include:
>
> 1. Children who have not reached puberty are not obligated to fast.
> 2. Those who are mentally ill or mentally incapacitated are exempt.
> 3. People who are traveling long distances, especially if it would be excessively burdensome to fast while traveling.
> 4. Pregnant or nursing women, if fasting would endanger their health or the health of their child.
> 5. Women who are menstruating or experiencing postpartum bleeding are exempt from fasting until they are no longer in this state.
> 6. Those who are elderly or chronically ill and for whom fasting would be excessively difficult or harmful.
>
> It's important to note that individuals who are exempt from fasting during Ramadan are often expected to make up for missed fasts at a later time or to provide compensation, such as feeding a needy person for each day missed.

In essence, Qiyas allows for reasoned interpretations and exceptions, ensuring that Islamic law remains adaptable to various circumstances through analogy and thoughtful analysis.
