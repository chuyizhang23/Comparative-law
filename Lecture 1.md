## Introduction

### General idea

Comparative law aims to study different law systems to analyze the differences and similarities between the different existing law systems.

There are common issues in every legal system -- lawyers must answer the same questions: What is family law? Is this divorce possible? etc.

Different areas of law:

- Public law

  > Public law is the part of law that governs relations and affairs between legal persons and a government, between different institutions within a state, between different branches of governments, as well as relationships between persons that are of direct concern to society.
- Civil law

  > Civil law is a major branch of the law. In common law legal systems the term refers to non-criminal law.
  - ==Tort law==

    > A tort is a civil wrong that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act. Tort law can be contrasted with criminal law, which deals with criminal wrongs that are punishable by the state. While criminal law aims to punish individuals who commit crimes, tort law aims to **compensate** individuals who suffer harm as a result of the actions of others.

### Jurisprudence and comparative law

Jurisprudence is made by judgment, the aim of which is to figure out how the societal context affects the actions of people and how laws can attempt to explain certain social situations. It is called philosophy of law in the French context, referring to a theory on the nature of law.

> Jurisprudence is concerned primarily with what the law is and what it ought to be. That includes questions of **how persons and social relations are understood in legal terms**, and of the values in and of law.
>
> Philosophy of law is a branch of philosophy that examines the nature of law and law's relationship to other systems of norms, especially ethics and political philosophy.

Comparative law studies concrete cases, not to make theories about law but to compare several situations and then determine what leads to different solutions.

### Difficulties faced by comparative law

We will need to be capable of differentiating the differences between different legal systems. However, it is difficult to determine the criteria of comparing and what could be comparable.

Sometimes, itâ€™s hard to make comparisons between different legal systems with distinct backgrounds, such as Western, Chinese, and Islamic. But legal systems that are very close are also hard to compare.

It is harder to compare more than two systems due to the analysis approach.

## Elements of classification

Traditionally, different legal systems are classified into several groups based on geographical justification. There are different areas of civilization, and must see it from different points of view.

In the oriental, we have Muslim and Chinese legal systems.

In the occidental, we have two main legal systems: the continental law system (civil law) and the general law system.

### Continental law system

The civil law system is of romaine origin -- *Body of civil law*. It was settled during the romaine empire and the main collects, *code of Justina*. The principle is that all laws are put into the same book as a codex.

> The *Corpus Juris* (or *Iuris*) *Civilis* ("Body of Civil Law") is the modern name for a collection of fundamental works in jurisprudence, issued (vague) from 529 to 534 by order of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I.
>
> The work as planned had three parts: the *Code* (*Codex*) is a compilation, by selection and extraction, of imperial enactments to date; the *Digest* or *Pandects* (the Latin title contains both *Digesta* and *Pandectae*) is an encyclopedia composed of mostly brief extracts from the writings of Roman jurists; and the *Institutes* (*Institutiones*) is a student textbook, mainly introducing the Code, although it has important conceptual elements that are less developed in the Code or the Digest. All three parts, even the textbook, were given force of law. They were intended to be, together, the sole source of law; reference to any other source, including the original texts from which the *Code* and the *Digest* had been taken, was forbidden. Nonetheless, Justinian found himself having to enact further laws; today these are counted as a fourth part of the Corpus, the *Novellae Constitutiones* (*Novels*, literally *New Laws*).
>
> The "Codex Justinianus", "Codex Justinianeus" or "Codex Justiniani" (Latin for "Justinian's Code") was the first part to be finished, on 7 April 529.

Roman law has a profound influence on our modern legal system. We have guidelines in Latin to determine and analyze cases. In the Common law system, there are no exact codes but still Roman legacies.

Roman law was influenced during the Middle Ages by the legal practices of the barbarians from Eastern Europe, particularly Germany. These people had no written laws but only oral custom law that was applied case-by-case by the judges.

### General law system
