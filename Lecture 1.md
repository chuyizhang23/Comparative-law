## Introduction

### General idea

Comparative law aims to study different law systems to analyze the differences and similarities between the different existing law systems.

There are common issues in every legal system -- lawyers must answer the same questions: What is family law? Is this divorce possible? etc.

Different areas of law:

- Public law

  > Public law is the part of law that governs relations and affairs between legal persons and a government, between different institutions within a state, between different branches of governments, as well as relationships between persons that are of direct concern to society.
- Civil law

  > Civil law is a major branch of the law. In common law legal systems the term refers to non-criminal law.
  - ==Tort law==

    > A tort is a civil wrong that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act. Tort law can be contrasted with criminal law, which deals with criminal wrongs that are punishable by the state. While criminal law aims to punish individuals who commit crimes, tort law aims to **compensate** individuals who suffer harm as a result of the actions of others.

### Jurisprudence and comparative law

Jurisprudence is made by judgment, the aim of which is to figure out how the societal context affects the actions of people and how laws can attempt to explain certain social situations. It is called philosophy of law in the French context, referring to a theory on the nature of law.

> Jurisprudence is concerned primarily with what the law is and what it ought to be. That includes questions of **how persons and social relations are understood in legal terms**, and of the values in and of law.
>
> Philosophy of law is a branch of philosophy that examines the nature of law and law's relationship to other systems of norms, especially ethics and political philosophy.

Comparative law studies concrete cases, not to make theories about law but to compare several situations and then determine what leads to different solutions.

### Difficulties faced by comparative law

We will need to be capable of differentiating the differences between different legal systems. However, it is difficult to determine the criteria of comparing and what could be comparable.

Sometimes, it’s hard to make comparisons between different legal systems with distinct backgrounds, such as Western, Chinese, and Islamic. But legal systems that are very close are also hard to compare.

It is harder to compare more than two systems due to the analysis approach.

## Elements of classification

Traditionally, different legal systems are classified into several groups based on geographical justification. There are different areas of civilization, and must see it from different points of view.

In the oriental, we have Muslim and Chinese legal systems.

In the occidental, we have two main legal systems: the continental law system (civil law) and the general law system.

### Continental law system

The civil law system is of romaine origin -- *Body of civil law*. It was settled during the romaine empire and the main collects, *code of Justina*. The principle is that all laws are put into the same book as a codex.

> The *Corpus Juris* (or *Iuris*) *Civilis* ("Body of Civil Law") is the modern name for a collection of fundamental works in jurisprudence, issued (vague) from 529 to 534 by order of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I.
>
> The work as planned had three parts: the *Code* (*Codex*) is a compilation, by selection and extraction, of imperial enactments to date; the *Digest* or *Pandects* (the Latin title contains both *Digesta* and *Pandectae*) is an encyclopedia composed of mostly brief extracts from the writings of Roman jurists; and the *Institutes* (*Institutiones*) is a student textbook, mainly introducing the Code, although it has important conceptual elements that are less developed in the Code or the Digest. All three parts, even the textbook, were given force of law. They were intended to be, together, the sole source of law; reference to any other source, including the original texts from which the *Code* and the *Digest* had been taken, was forbidden. Nonetheless, Justinian found himself having to enact further laws; today these are counted as a fourth part of the Corpus, the *Novellae Constitutiones* (*Novels*, literally *New Laws*).
>
> The "Codex Justinianus", "Codex Justinianeus" or "Codex Justiniani" (Latin for "Justinian's Code") was the first part to be finished, on 7 April 529.

Roman law has a profound influence on our modern legal system. We have guidelines in Latin to determine and analyze cases. In the Common law system, there are no exact codes but still Roman legacies.

Roman law was influenced during the Middle Ages by the legal practices of the barbarians from Eastern Europe, particularly Germany. These people had no written laws but only oral custom law that was applied case-by-case by the judges. Roman and Barbarians coexistence, meaning there was no general legal system that applied to all people. Different rules applied to different people according to their origins: most of the population is ruled by Roman law, while Germans are ruled by their local customs. During this period, there were intermarriages between them, which led to the mix of these two legal systems.

*Example: The application of the traditional custom in France. On the succession of the tribes, only sons but not daughters could inherit after their father died. And the succession of the monarchy is similar in France, according to which women were not legally attending to the throne. Compared to the situation in the UK where women could hold the throne.*

In the North of Europe, the legal systems are based on the application of oral law with the influence of the German tribes' legal customs. Notice that the German tribes' legal customs are mixed with the principle of Roman law.

In Italy and northern Spain, which were not occupied by the Muslims, romaine law is applied. The universities have been the place where romaine law was studied as a kind of philosophy of law, "what could be law?" The lawyers graduated in the Romaine law environment, and when they moved north they brought with them the Romaine law principle. There are also legal vocabularies inherited from Romains.

### Common law system

The common law system was born on the British island and expanded to the US and Africa with the expansion of the British. It consists of principles of Roman law and custom law, which also known as Anglo-Saxon law that originated from the custom of Normandy.

*In this island, lawyers have to go to have an internship to learn the custom of Normandy in Normandy, because there is still a specialty of Jersey and Guernsey(channel islands). These islands are a kind of fiscal paradise, wealthy people went there since they are not included in the EU, EU law does not apply. Also, they have the competences of the system of inheritance, people does not need to pay a huge tax for inheritance. It has a very big economic importance and still apply some of the Normandy customs.*

> The phrase "**law exists in text**" refers to the idea that the primary form of law is expressed through written documents, such as statutes, regulations, constitutions, treaties, judicial opinions, and legal codes. In other words, the law is primarily derived from written sources rather than unwritten traditions or customs.
>
> This concept is particularly relevant in formal legal systems, such as those based on civil law or common law traditions. In civil law systems, comprehensive legal codes often codify the majority of legal rules and principles, providing a systematic framework for addressing various legal matters. Similarly, in common law systems, judicial decisions and precedents are documented in written opinions, which serve as authoritative sources of law for future cases.
>
> "Law exists in text" emphasizes the importance of written documents as the primary means of establishing legal norms, rights, obligations, and procedures. It implies that legal rules and principles must be clearly articulated and accessible in written form to be enforceable and applicable within the legal system.
>
> However, it's essential to recognize that while written texts form the foundation of the law, interpretation and application of legal principles often require consideration of context, legislative intent, judicial reasoning, and societal norms. Therefore, while the law is grounded in written texts, its understanding and application may also involve analysis beyond the literal words of statutes or judicial opinions.

In common law systems, judges will rule with the application of written laws. But written laws cannot predict everything, so when judges apply them to specific cases, they analyze the case and give a solution that will be specific from case to case. If the law is clear, the judge has to apply strictly the law with the interpretation of the law.

*Art. 6 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) says, “Law is the expression of general will.” The principle is that law is voted by representatives of the people, and what is voted by the representatives is what the people want. So the judge is the servant of the law and the servant of what people want. This idea has been exported to different legal systems, such as those in Germany and Italy.*

A large part of the law is made with customs and the rule of precedent. The judge is also a lawmaker, and he is able, by his interpretation, to build some rules in the legal systems. For example, the judge can rule by the decisions made by old judges. Also, if new elements or solutions need to be made for new cases, the judges will have to interpret the laws on their own in order to solve the case.

> "The ==rule of precedent==," also known as "stare decisis," is a fundamental principle in common law legal systems. It refers to the practice of courts following the decisions of earlier courts when the same legal issues arise in subsequent cases. Under the rule of precedent, decisions made by higher courts establish binding authority on lower courts within the same jurisdiction.
>
> Key aspects of the rule of precedent include:
>
> 1. **Binding Authority**: When a higher court issues a decision on a particular legal issue, that decision becomes binding precedent for lower courts within the same jurisdiction. Lower courts are required to follow the legal reasoning and outcome established by the higher court.
> 2. **Hierarchy of Courts**: Precedents set by higher courts carry more weight than those set by lower courts. Decisions from appellate courts, such as the Supreme Court in the United States or the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom, have greater precedential value than decisions from trial courts.
> 3. **Consistency and Predictability**: The rule of precedent promotes consistency and predictability in the legal system by ensuring that similar cases are treated similarly over time. It helps to establish clear legal principles and standards that guide future decisions.
> 4. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: While the rule of precedent provides stability and consistency, it also allows for the evolution of the law over time. Courts can distinguish earlier precedents or overturn them in exceptional cases when circumstances warrant a change in legal interpretation or when the precedent is found to be incorrect or outdated.
> 5. **Exceptions and Overruling**: In certain circumstances, courts may depart from established precedent. This can occur when a higher court explicitly overrules a previous decision, when a precedent is found to be inconsistent with higher legal principles or developments, or when significant societal or legal changes necessitate a different approach.
>
> Overall, the rule of precedent is a cornerstone of the common law system, promoting legal stability, consistency, and fairness while allowing for the gradual development and adaptation of the law in response to changing circumstances and societal values.

Common laws exist not only in England but are also exported to other countries. "Common Laws” is in plural because when a former territory of the British becomes independent, their political party will be able to vote for their own body. So that other countries can have some specificities while having common law backgrounds. That’s why we have different common-law countries, e.g., Canada and South Africa.

*Example: competition laws. The freedom of treading is part of individual freedom, but no freedom is absolute. We have competition law, which seems to be in conflict with the principle of freedom, meaning competition law would be an exception to the freedom of trade. In cases of perturbation, the negation of freedom of trade leads to monopolies. **The rule of reason**: once there is a merger of businesses, the judges will have to determine if the merger will become a monopoly and a risk to the freedom of trade.*

> The "==Rule of Reason==" is a legal principle primarily associated with antitrust or competition law. It originated in the United States and is used to analyze whether certain business practices violate antitrust laws, particularly those concerning monopolization and restraint of trade.
>
> The Rule of Reason contrasts with per se rules, which declare certain types of conduct as inherently illegal without considering the specific context or effects. Instead, the Rule of Reason requires courts to conduct a more nuanced analysis, taking into account the particular circumstances surrounding the alleged anticompetitive conduct.
>
> Key aspects of the Rule of Reason include:
>
> 1. **Analysis of Competitive Effects**: Under the Rule of Reason, courts evaluate whether a particular business practice has an anticompetitive effect on the market. This involves considering factors such as market power, potential consumer harm, innovation, and efficiency.
> 2. **Balancing Procompetitive and Anticompetitive Effects**: The Rule of Reason requires courts to weigh the potential benefits of the challenged conduct against its potential harm to competition. Practices that enhance competition, promote consumer welfare, or improve efficiency are more likely to be considered lawful under this analysis.
> 3. **Case-by-Case Evaluation**: Rather than applying a blanket rule to all similar types of conduct, the Rule of Reason necessitates a case-by-case evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances. This allows courts to assess the competitive impact of the conduct in question and tailor their analysis accordingly.
> 4. **Evidentiary Burden**: Both plaintiffs and defendants in antitrust cases bear the burden of presenting evidence to support their respective positions under the Rule of Reason. Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the challenged conduct harms competition, while defendants may argue that the conduct benefits consumers or enhances efficiency.
> 5. **Judicial Discretion**: Courts have considerable discretion in applying the Rule of Reason, allowing them to adapt the analysis to evolving market conditions and legal principles.
>
> Overall, the Rule of Reason serves as a flexible framework for evaluating potentially anticompetitive business practices, striking a balance between promoting competition and allowing businesses to engage in legitimate procompetitive conduct. It requires courts to carefully weigh the competitive effects of the conduct in question and make informed decisions based on the specific facts of each case.

## Principles of civil law systems

### Written law

The civil law system comes from continental Europe. It was very influenced by Roman law. The main characteristic is that it is a legal system organized with statutes, meaning written laws written by the institution and voted by parliaments.

> ==Statutes==, in the legal context, are laws enacted by a legislative body, such as a parliament, congress, or local government. They are one of the primary sources of law in most legal systems. Statutes are typically written and codified into law books or codes, organized by subject matter.

#### Customs in civil law systems

However, customs do exist in civil law systems in addition to the written laws. The situation is different from country to country.

In France, there are very few customs still in place since there were few customs that applied to the whole country during the old regime. In 1781, the new regime wanted to apply the principle of unity, which still applies in the Constitution of 1968. During the revolution, one legislation and one government were wanted.

*Example: in France, the judge can refer to local customs to review the fences.*

> In French law, the concept of "enclosure" or "clôture" refers to the legal framework surrounding property boundaries and fencing. The French Civil Code, particularly Articles 646 to 682, provides regulations concerning the establishment, maintenance, and disputes related to fences and property boundaries.

The reason local customs exist in the French legal system is because France has overseas territories. Take family law or funeral law as examples. They have to do with the regime of the property. There is a collective property regulation in the tribe, and the tribe leader is elected. The tribal members have the choice of being ruled by national law or local customary laws.

In Germany and Italy (divided into several kingdoms), customary laws still apply.

#### Codes

The texts of law are based on regional laws on statues, characters, and the existence of qualifications. The laws are not only voted on but also presented in a book called Codex. This is a Roman tradition that was adopted again during the Napoleonic period. The empire decided the state would print some ‘codes thématiques’, such as penal code, administrative code, tax code, and trading code. About 20 codes existed in France at that time. The lawyers find it easier to work with the codes; while writing sentences, they just have to refer to the article.

In reality, the codes proceed with general principles that are abstractions that the lawyer will apply to the concrete situations that he has to solve.

> The Napoleonic Code, also known as the French Civil Code (Code civil des Français), primarily contains general principles of law rather than specific details. It was promulgated by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804 and served as the foundation of modern French civil law. While the code provides a comprehensive framework for civil law matters, its provisions are framed in broad and general terms, outlining fundamental legal principles and concepts.
>
> Here are some key characteristics of the Napoleonic Code:
>
> 1. **Principle-based Approach**: The Napoleonic Code is structured around core legal principles, such as equality before the law, freedom of contract, property rights, and the sanctity of private property. These principles serve as the basis for regulating various legal relationships, including contracts, property rights, family law, and inheritance.
> 2. **Simplicity and Clarity**: One of the objectives of the Napoleonic Code was to create a concise and accessible legal code that could be easily understood and applied by judges, lawyers, and citizens. As such, the code's language is relatively straightforward, and its provisions are written in a clear and concise manner.
> 3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: While the Napoleonic Code provides general principles of law, it also allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing social, economic, and legal circumstances. The code's broad principles can be applied to a wide range of situations, and courts have the authority to interpret and apply its provisions in light of contemporary legal norms and values.
> 4. **Supplemented by Case Law and Legal Doctrine**: While the Napoleonic Code serves as the foundation of French civil law, it is supplemented by case law (jurisprudence) and legal doctrine (doctrine juridique). Courts interpret and apply the code's provisions in the context of specific cases, and legal scholars provide commentary and analysis to clarify and interpret its principles.
> 5. **Influence on Civil Law Systems**: The Napoleonic Code has had a significant influence on civil law systems around the world, particularly in Europe and other parts of the former French Empire. Many countries have adopted elements of the code's legal principles and structure in their own civil codes or legal systems.
>
> Overall, while the Napoleonic Code contains general principles of law rather than specific details, its provisions provide a foundational framework for regulating civil law matters and have played a crucial role in shaping modern legal systems.

Example: Art. 1240. Civil Code in 1804: “If someone provokes some torts to anyone, it has to pay back amenities to the victim.” It is an abstraction. This text is completely applied by judges, meaning the judge has to check in each case if any crime committed by someone can be considered a fault. Fault means any illegal behavior. The job of the judge is to determine first if there is a tort and, secondly, whether this tort is coming from a fault or not. If a fact is made by the victim, the victim normally has the right to receive compensation, but in this case, the judge has the responsibility to assess both parties to determine if there are any shared responsibilities, like what is the fault of the victim or the other.

To determine the amount of compensation, the judge also has to make an analysis. He has to check what difficulties the victim is facing after the accident. Here in the civil law system, the judge is not a lawmaker because his duty is just to apply the abstractive law to the case he has to solve, but he cannot make any interpretation of the law. He can make determinations, but he is leaned to the law. Even if the judge is not a lawmaker, his job is still important. The judge has quite the power to decide how to apply the law, for example, the tort law in France.

### Role of judges

In civil law, there is the application of what is called the **inquisitorial system**, meaning that during the trial, the judge dominates and leads the trial. The judge is not neutral, but inside the process, he is not just waiting for all the comments; he is active and leading the trial. In this system, the prosecutors are involved in the case and in the investigation. During a criminal trial, the judge listens to the representatives; he can also directly act by himself, not being led by the arguments made by the barrister in front of him.

> The ==inquisitorial system== is a legal system used in some countries, primarily in continental Europe and parts of Latin America, as an alternative to the adversarial system. In an inquisitorial system, the court or tribunal takes a more active role in investigating the facts of a case, gathering evidence, and determining the truth, compared to the adversarial system where the parties themselves are primarily responsible for presenting evidence and arguments.
>
> Key characteristics of the inquisitorial system include:
>
> 1. **Role of the Judge**: In an inquisitorial system, the judge or panel of judges plays a central role in overseeing the legal proceedings and directing the investigation. The judge takes an active role in questioning witnesses, examining evidence, and seeking to uncover the truth of the matter at hand.
> 2. **Investigative Procedure**: In contrast to the adversarial system, where the parties conduct their own investigations and present evidence to support their arguments, the inquisitorial system relies on a formalized investigative procedure conducted by the court or an investigating magistrate. This may involve witness testimony, expert reports, documentary evidence, and other means of gathering information.
> 3. **Emphasis on Truth and Equity**: The inquisitorial system places a strong emphasis on discovering the truth and administering justice in a fair and equitable manner. Judges are tasked with ensuring that all relevant evidence is considered, and that the rights of the parties are protected throughout the legal proceedings.
> 4. **Limited Role for Parties**: While parties to a case in an inquisitorial system have the opportunity to present their arguments and evidence, their role is typically more limited compared to the adversarial system. Parties may be questioned by the judge, but they do not have the same level of control over the proceedings as in an adversarial system.
> 5. **Use of Legal Professionals**: In inquisitorial systems, legal professionals such as judges, prosecutors, and investigating magistrates play a significant role in conducting the legal process. These professionals are responsible for conducting investigations, presenting evidence, and making legal arguments on behalf of the state or the parties involved in the case.
>
> It's important to note that while the inquisitorial system is used in some countries, many legal systems around the world, including common law jurisdictions like the United States and the United Kingdom, primarily use the adversarial system. Each system has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them often reflects historical, cultural, and institutional factors within a particular country or legal tradition.

Another characteristic is that in the civil law system, judges act as civil servants. Comparing the situation In the US, federal and local judges are elected or appointed by the government. In the common law system, being a judge is not a career. However, in the civil law system, being a judge is a choice of career, starting quite young. Students need to have a master degree, which means in their 20s they have to have some internships, legal exams, training in school in Paris, then start their career as barristers and in the administrative system of justice. They are public or civil servants because they are working for the states, controlled by the administration of justice. They are not involved with lobbying, etc. They are arriving young, without much leaning toward other interests. But a young judge with too little experience can make mistakes.
