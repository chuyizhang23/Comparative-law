## Introduction

### General idea

Comparative law aims to study different law systems to analyze the differences and similarities between the different existing law systems.

There are common issues in every legal system -- lawyers must answer the same questions: What is family law? Is this divorce possible? etc.

Different areas of law:

- Public law

  > Public law is the part of law that governs relations and affairs between legal persons and a government, between different institutions within a state, between different branches of governments, as well as relationships between persons that are of direct concern to society.
- Civil law

  > Civil law is a major branch of the law. In common law legal systems the term refers to non-criminal law.
  - ==Tort law==

    > A tort is a civil wrong that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act. Tort law can be contrasted with criminal law, which deals with criminal wrongs that are punishable by the state. While criminal law aims to punish individuals who commit crimes, tort law aims to **compensate** individuals who suffer harm as a result of the actions of others.

### Jurisprudence and comparative law

Jurisprudence is made by judgment, the aim of which is to figure out how the societal context affects the actions of people and how laws can attempt to explain certain social situations. It is called philosophy of law in the French context, referring to a theory on the nature of law.

> Jurisprudence is concerned primarily with what the law is and what it ought to be. That includes questions of **how persons and social relations are understood in legal terms**, and of the values in and of law.
>
> Philosophy of law is a branch of philosophy that examines the nature of law and law's relationship to other systems of norms, especially ethics and political philosophy.

Comparative law studies concrete cases, not to make theories about law but to compare several situations and then determine what leads to different solutions.

### Difficulties faced by comparative law

We will need to be capable of differentiating the differences between different legal systems.

It is difficult to determine the criteria of comparing and what could be comparable.

Sometimes, itâ€™s hard to make comparisons between different legal systems with distinct backgrounds, such as Western, Chinese, and Islamic.

Legal systems that are very close are also hard to compare.

It is harder to compare more than two systems due to the analysis approach.
