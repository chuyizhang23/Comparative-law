## Introduction

### General idea

Comparative law aims to study different law systems to analyze the differences and similarities between the different existing law systems.

There are common issues in every legal system -- lawyers must answer the same questions: What is family law? Is this divorce possible? etc.

Different areas of law:

- Public law

  > Public law is the part of law that governs relations and affairs between legal persons and a government, between different institutions within a state, between different branches of governments, as well as relationships between persons that are of direct concern to society.
- Civil law

  > Civil law is a major branch of the law. In common law legal systems the term refers to non-criminal law.
  - ==Tort law==

    > A tort is a civil wrong that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act. Tort law can be contrasted with criminal law, which deals with criminal wrongs that are punishable by the state. While criminal law aims to punish individuals who commit crimes, tort law aims to **compensate** individuals who suffer harm as a result of the actions of others.

### Jurisprudence and comparative law

Jurisprudence is made by judgment, the aim of which is to figure out how the societal context affects the actions of people and how laws can attempt to explain certain social situations. It is called philosophy of law in the French context, referring to a theory on the nature of law.

> Jurisprudence is concerned primarily with what the law is and what it ought to be. That includes questions of **how persons and social relations are understood in legal terms**, and of the values in and of law.
>
> Philosophy of law is a branch of philosophy that examines the nature of law and law's relationship to other systems of norms, especially ethics and political philosophy.

Comparative law studies concrete cases, not to make theories about law but to compare several situations and then determine what leads to different solutions.

### Difficulties faced by comparative law

We will need to be capable of differentiating the differences between different legal systems. However, it is difficult to determine the criteria of comparing and what could be comparable.

Sometimes, it’s hard to make comparisons between different legal systems with distinct backgrounds, such as Western, Chinese, and Islamic. But legal systems that are very close are also hard to compare.

It is harder to compare more than two systems due to the analysis approach.

## Elements of classification

Traditionally, different legal systems are classified into several groups based on geographical justification. There are different areas of civilization, and must see it from different points of view.

In the oriental, we have Muslim and Chinese legal systems.

In the occidental, we have two main legal systems: the continental law system (civil law) and the general law system.

### Continental law system

The civil law system is of romaine origin -- *Body of civil law*. It was settled during the romaine empire and the main collects, *code of Justina*. The principle is that all laws are put into the same book as a codex.

> The *Corpus Juris* (or *Iuris*) *Civilis* ("Body of Civil Law") is the modern name for a collection of fundamental works in jurisprudence, issued (vague) from 529 to 534 by order of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I.
>
> The work as planned had three parts: the *Code* (*Codex*) is a compilation, by selection and extraction, of imperial enactments to date; the *Digest* or *Pandects* (the Latin title contains both *Digesta* and *Pandectae*) is an encyclopedia composed of mostly brief extracts from the writings of Roman jurists; and the *Institutes* (*Institutiones*) is a student textbook, mainly introducing the Code, although it has important conceptual elements that are less developed in the Code or the Digest. All three parts, even the textbook, were given force of law. They were intended to be, together, the sole source of law; reference to any other source, including the original texts from which the *Code* and the *Digest* had been taken, was forbidden. Nonetheless, Justinian found himself having to enact further laws; today these are counted as a fourth part of the Corpus, the *Novellae Constitutiones* (*Novels*, literally *New Laws*).
>
> The "Codex Justinianus", "Codex Justinianeus" or "Codex Justiniani" (Latin for "Justinian's Code") was the first part to be finished, on 7 April 529.

Roman law has a profound influence on our modern legal system. We have guidelines in Latin to determine and analyze cases. In the Common law system, there are no exact codes but still Roman legacies.

Roman law was influenced during the Middle Ages by the legal practices of the barbarians from Eastern Europe, particularly Germany. These people had no written laws but only oral custom law that was applied case-by-case by the judges. Roman and Barbarians coexistence, meaning there was no general legal system that applied to all people. Different rules applied to different people according to their origins: most of the population is ruled by Roman law, while Germans are ruled by their local customs. During this period, there were intermarriages between them, which led to the mix of these two legal systems.

Example: The application of the traditional custom in France. On the succession of the tribes, only sons but not daughters could inherit after their father died. And the succession of the monarchy is similar in France, according to which women were not legally attending to the throne. Compared to the situation in the UK where women could hold the throne.

In the North of Europe, the legal systems are based on the application of oral law with the influence of the German tribes' legal customs. Notice that the German tribes' legal customs are mixed with the principle of Roman law.

In Italy and northern Spain, which were not occupied by the Muslims, romaine law is applied. The universities have been the place where romaine law was studied as a kind of philosophy of law, "what could be law?" The lawyers graduated in the Romaine law environment, and when they moved north they brought with them the Romaine law principle. There are also legal vocabularies inherited from Romains.

### Common law system

The common law system was born on the British island and expanded to the US and Africa with the expansion of the British. It consists of principles of Roman law and custom law, which also known as Anglo-Saxon law that originated from the custom of Normandy.

In this island, lawyers have to go to have an internship to learn the custom of Normandy in Normandy, because there is still a specialty of Jersey and Guernsey(channel islands). These islands are a kind of fiscal paradise, wealthy people went there since they are not included in the EU, EU law does not apply. Also, they have the competences of the system of inheritance, people does not need to pay a huge tax for inheritance. It has a very big economic importance and still apply some of the Normandy customs.

> The phrase "**law exists in text**" refers to the idea that the primary form of law is expressed through written documents, such as statutes, regulations, constitutions, treaties, judicial opinions, and legal codes. In other words, the law is primarily derived from written sources rather than unwritten traditions or customs.
>
> This concept is particularly relevant in formal legal systems, such as those based on civil law or common law traditions. In civil law systems, comprehensive legal codes often codify the majority of legal rules and principles, providing a systematic framework for addressing various legal matters. Similarly, in common law systems, judicial decisions and precedents are documented in written opinions, which serve as authoritative sources of law for future cases.
>
> "Law exists in text" emphasizes the importance of written documents as the primary means of establishing legal norms, rights, obligations, and procedures. It implies that legal rules and principles must be clearly articulated and accessible in written form to be enforceable and applicable within the legal system.
>
> However, it's essential to recognize that while written texts form the foundation of the law, interpretation and application of legal principles often require consideration of context, legislative intent, judicial reasoning, and societal norms. Therefore, while the law is grounded in written texts, its understanding and application may also involve analysis beyond the literal words of statutes or judicial opinions.

In common law systems, judges will rule with the application of written laws. But written laws cannot predict everything, so when judges apply them to specific cases, they analyze the case and give a solution that will be specific from case to case. If the law is clear, the judge has to apply strictly the law with the interpretation of the law.

Art. 6 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, 1789, says, “Law is the expression of general will.” The principle is that law is voted by representatives of the people, and what is voted by the representatives is what the people want. So the judge is the servant of the law and the servant of what people want.
