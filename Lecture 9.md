## Public institutions in China (continue)

### Political institutions (continue)

#### The president of the republic

The President of the People's Republic of China is elected by the National People's Congress. At the same time, a Vice President is elected under the same conditions. Typically, both the President and the Vice President are members of the Communist Party of China. While there are eight other legally recognized political parties in China, these parties are officially independent but operate under the leadership of the CPC and are part of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). They accept the guiding role of the Communist Party. Therefore, the system is not truly multiparty or democratic in the sense commonly understood in liberal democracies.

The President of the People's Republic of China is a principal executive authority and holds significant power. He has two main responsibilities. First, the President is the leader of diplomacy and international affairs, responsible for organizing and developing China's relationships with other countries. Second, he oversees emergency situations, holding powers related to national defense and leading the response during such times. Additionally, he has the authority to submit legislative proposals to the National People's Congress. While the National People's Congress holds legislative power, the President possesses the initiative to propose laws to the Parliament.

#### the Council of State Affairs

The State Council, or Council of State Affairs, is essentially the national government of China. It is led by the Premier (Prime Minister) and the Vice Premiers, and all ministers are members of this council. The main task of the State Council is to oversee the administration of the country. It functions as an executive office, responsible for implementing the decisions made by the National People's Congress (the legislative branch) and the President (the executive branch).

Remember that because China is governed by principles of communism, there is always a parallel structure between the Communist Party and the various levels of the parliament and administration. In reality, the President of the People's Republic is not only the head of state but also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. Other officials likewise hold leadership positions within the Communist Party at lower ranks. This results in a highly centralized system where the core of administration is centered around the President, who maintains relationships with both the legislative body—the National People's Congress—and the executive body—the State Council.

In reality, a similar system exists at the provincial level. In the provinces, there is a local parliament called the Local People's Congress. The Local People's Congress elects the governor of the province or the mayor of the municipality. As previously mentioned, there are various levels of administration. The Local People's Congress is responsible for electing the governor and vice governor (or mayor and vice mayor, in the case of municipalities). There is also an executive body—not called the State Council, of course—but the Provincial People's Government, which serves as the local government with provincial ministers. The distribution of competencies mirrors that at the national level, with the government responsible for leading all administrative activities.

### The organization of justice

#### Courts

In China, the judicial system is organized into three main categories of courts:

> 1. **The Supreme People's Court**: This is the highest judicial authority in China, responsible for supervising the administration of justice by all subordinate courts.
>
> 2. **Local People's Courts**: These general trial courts are divided into three levels:
>    - **Higher People's Courts** at the provincial level.
>    - **Intermediate People's Courts** at the prefecture or municipal level.
>    - **Basic People's Courts** at the county or district level.
>
> 3. **Special People's Courts**: These courts handle specialized cases and include:
>    - **Military Courts**: Deal with matters involving military personnel.
>    - **Maritime Courts**: Handle maritime and shipping disputes.
>    - **Railway Transport Courts**: Address cases related to railway transportation.
>    - **Forestry Courts**: Focus on cases involving forestry and environmental issues.

Firstly, there is the Supreme People's Court, which is equivalent to the Supreme Court in the United States in terms of being the highest judicial authority. However, its competencies differ due to the distinct nature of China's legal system. The Supreme People's Court is responsible for establishing procedural rules and for reviewing and revising judgments issued by lower courts. Additionally, it oversees the administrative supervision of other courts. In other words, the Supreme People's Court functions both as a court of appeal and as an oversight body that controls the administration of justice. This means it possesses both judicial authority and administrative responsibilities related to supervision.

At the second level, we have the **local courts**, which are the courts operating within specific territorial jurisdictions. These local courts are divided into three levels:

1. **Basic People's Courts**: These are the courts of first instance, where most cases are initially heard. When individuals have a legal dispute, they typically start at the basic court level.

2. **Intermediate People's Courts**: These courts function primarily as courts of appeal, reviewing decisions from the basic courts. They handle cases that require a higher level of judicial scrutiny or appeals from lower court rulings.

3. **Higher People's Courts**: While not equivalent to the Supreme Court, these courts are the highest judicial authority within the local jurisdictions (provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities). They oversee certain significant cases and can review and reform decisions made by lower courts. After a decision by the Higher People's Court, it is possible to appeal to the Supreme People's Court for further review.

In this three-tiered local court system, the Intermediate People's Court acts as an appellate body, and the Higher People's Court addresses more complex cases and higher-level appeals. Judges in these local courts are appointed by the corresponding local People's Congresses.

The third category of courts in China consists of special courts. Special courts are courts that do not handle general legal matters but are responsible for specific types of cases. For example, there are special courts dedicated to intellectual property, so when cases involve intellectual property disputes, they are brought before these specialized courts rather than the general courts. Similarly, financial courts focus on financial and commercial cases.

> Other examples of special courts include military courts, which handle matters involving military personnel, and maritime courts, which deal with maritime and shipping disputes.

#### Chambers

Both the Supreme People's Court and local courts in China are organized into specialized divisions known as chambers. Each chamber focuses on specific types of cases, such as **criminal**, **civil**, **administrative**, or **economic** matters. A chamber is essentially a section within the court that handles a particular category of legal affairs. This means that not all judges in the court adjudicate every case; instead, cases are assigned to the appropriate chamber staffed by judges with expertise in that area of law.

Previously, we mentioned that there are four chambers within the court system. One of these chambers specializes in economic matters, which include commercial law and business law. Although contracts are generally considered part of civil law, in the Chinese legal system there is not a clear division between civil contracts and commercial contracts. For example, in the French legal system, there are two different codes: the Civil Code and the Commercial Code. Contracts can be classified as civil contracts—for instance, when you rent an apartment or purchase a car, these are considered civil contracts. On the other hand, commercial contracts in French law are those involving transactions between two professionals or traders.In civil contracts, the parties are typically private individuals who are not professionals or traders specialized in the relevant field. In the Chinese legal system, this distinction does not really exist because the Civil Code encompasses all types of contracts. However, the Supreme People's Court has effectively developed what could be called a business law system by recognizing specific characteristics of contracts between professionals. Even though these specificities are not codified in a separate Commercial Code or Trade Code and are instead found within the Civil Code, they result not directly from statutory law but from the interpretation of the law by the Supreme People's Court.

Additionally, there is an Administrative Chamber within the courts. The Administrative Chamber is responsible for the application of administrative law, encompassing all the rules enforced by national and local public bodies. This highlights a specific aspect of the Chinese legal system. As previously mentioned, the Chinese legal system is inspired by the continental law system, which is characterized by codified laws. In the continental legal tradition, there is a specific conception of the separation of powers, with two distinct judicial bodies: one for private law (judicial courts) and one for public law (administrative courts). Traditionally, this means there are separate judicial systems for private and public law matters. In the traditional continental system, it is uncommon to have an administrative law chamber within a general court. However, this is the case in China. Chinese courts are general in their jurisdiction, and even though they are divided into specialized entities like chambers, one of these chambers specifically handles administrative cases. These cases involve decisions made by administrative bodies and the application of public law rather than private law. This integration of administrative law within the general court system is a distinctive feature of the Chinese legal system.

In addition, some courts may have other specialized chambers, depending on their organizational structure. For example, certain courts may include an environmental chamber or, in some provinces, an environmental court dedicated to environmental matters. Similarly, this applies to social law, which encompasses two main areas: on one hand, social welfare, involving the system of public insurance, and on the other hand, labor law, concerning the rights and duties of workers and the specifics of contracts between employees and employers. Therefore, there are courts that have specific chambers dedicated to these areas of law.

#### Judgement committee

In each court, there is a body called the Judgment Committee. This committee comprises the President, the Vice President, and some magistrates—not all magistrates, but a selected group who sit on this committee. The Judgment Committee has two main duties.

The first duty of the Judgment Committee is to examine the possibility of revising a judgment. This occurs when new evidence emerges after a court has rendered its decision. In such cases, the committee must assess the situation: Should they reopen the case and re-examine it because of the new information that was not available at the time of the original decision? Or should they determine that these new elements are not significant enough to alter the outcome of the prior judgment? This examination is called a revision because, if they decide to proceed, it involves reopening the case and conducting a new trial. Therefore, in each court, the Judgment Committee is responsible for reviewing all requests for the reopening of trials.

The second duty of the judgment committee is to receive and examine case files and assign them to the appropriate judges within the different chambers. It functions as a sort of selection committee. The committee reviews the files to ensure that all necessary documents are included for adjudication. If any documents are missing, it requests the barristers to provide the missing elements. The committee also decides whether the case should be assigned to the civil chamber, the criminal chamber, or another appropriate chamber. The judicial committee is an internal body within the court and is composed of the president, the vice president, and several magistrates drawn from different chambers.

> > Question: So each chamber is kind of like a judgment committee?
>
> No, the Judgment Committee operates at the level of the entire court. This includes the Supreme People's Court, Basic People's Courts, Intermediate People's Courts, Higher People's Courts, and Special Courts. In each court, there is a president and a vice president who handle the administration of the tribunal. Within each court, the Judgment Committee is composed of the president, vice president, and some magistrates—not all magistrates. When all magistrates convene, it is called a General Assembly, which meets for various purposes.
>
> The Judgment Committee consists of select magistrates, typically the senior members of the court, representing the different chambers—such as civil, criminal, and others. When they examine and select case files, they determine the assignment of cases to specific judges or chambers. This process is conducted at the level of the entire court, not within individual chamber

#### Procurators

In the Chinese legal system, there are prosecutors known as People's Procurators. These procurators are responsible for initiating legal proceedings, especially in criminal trials. They decide whether or not to prosecute individuals and oversee all procedural aspects of a case. At the criminal level, prosecutors serve as a crucial link between the police system and the judiciary. They collaborate with the police during investigations and are responsible for bringing charges against individuals in criminal cases.

The People's Procurators also play a vital role in defending the public interest. When offenses against public welfare occur, they are tasked with protecting that interest by pursuing legal action. They have the authority to request that individuals be detained or arrested during the investigation phase. Prosecutors examine cases to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with prosecution. This means that it is the prosecutor who decides whether someone should be arrested before and during the trial process. Therefore, prosecutors hold a very important duty within the Chinese legal system.
