## Public institutions in China (continue)

### Political institutions (continue)

#### The president of the republic

The President of the People's Republic of China is elected by the National People's Congress. At the same time, a Vice President is elected under the same conditions. Typically, both the President and the Vice President are members of the Communist Party of China. While there are eight other legally recognized political parties in China, these parties are officially independent but operate under the leadership of the CPC and are part of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). They accept the guiding role of the Communist Party. Therefore, the system is not truly multiparty or democratic in the sense commonly understood in liberal democracies.

The President of the People's Republic of China is a principal executive authority and holds significant power. He has two main responsibilities. First, the President is the leader of diplomacy and international affairs, responsible for organizing and developing China's relationships with other countries. Second, he oversees emergency situations, holding powers related to national defense and leading the response during such times. Additionally, he has the authority to submit legislative proposals to the National People's Congress. While the National People's Congress holds legislative power, the President possesses the initiative to propose laws to the Parliament.

#### the Council of State Affairs

The State Council, or Council of State Affairs, is essentially the national government of China. It is led by the Premier (Prime Minister) and the Vice Premiers, and all ministers are members of this council. The main task of the State Council is to oversee the administration of the country. It functions as an executive office, responsible for implementing the decisions made by the National People's Congress (the legislative branch) and the President (the executive branch).

Remember that because China is governed by principles of communism, there is always a parallel structure between the Communist Party and the various levels of the parliament and administration. In reality, the President of the People's Republic is not only the head of state but also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. Other officials likewise hold leadership positions within the Communist Party at lower ranks. This results in a highly centralized system where the core of administration is centered around the President, who maintains relationships with both the legislative body—the National People's Congress—and the executive body—the State Council.

In reality, a similar system exists at the provincial level. In the provinces, there is a local parliament called the Local People's Congress. The Local People's Congress elects the governor of the province or the mayor of the municipality. As previously mentioned, there are various levels of administration. The Local People's Congress is responsible for electing the governor and vice governor (or mayor and vice mayor, in the case of municipalities). There is also an executive body—not called the State Council, of course—but the Provincial People's Government, which serves as the local government with provincial ministers. The distribution of competencies mirrors that at the national level, with the government responsible for leading all administrative activities.

### The organization of justice

#### Courts

In China, the judicial system is organized into three main categories of courts:

> 1. **The Supreme People's Court**: This is the highest judicial authority in China, responsible for supervising the administration of justice by all subordinate courts.
>
> 2. **Local People's Courts**: These general trial courts are divided into three levels:
>    - **Higher People's Courts** at the provincial level.
>    - **Intermediate People's Courts** at the prefecture or municipal level.
>    - **Basic People's Courts** at the county or district level.
>
> 3. **Special People's Courts**: These courts handle specialized cases and include:
>    - **Military Courts**: Deal with matters involving military personnel.
>    - **Maritime Courts**: Handle maritime and shipping disputes.
>    - **Railway Transport Courts**: Address cases related to railway transportation.
>    - **Forestry Courts**: Focus on cases involving forestry and environmental issues.

Firstly, there is the Supreme People's Court, which is equivalent to the Supreme Court in the United States in terms of being the highest judicial authority. However, its competencies differ due to the distinct nature of China's legal system. The Supreme People's Court is responsible for establishing procedural rules and for reviewing and revising judgments issued by lower courts. Additionally, it oversees the administrative supervision of other courts. In other words, the Supreme People's Court functions both as a court of appeal and as an oversight body that controls the administration of justice. This means it possesses both judicial authority and administrative responsibilities related to supervision.

At the second level, we have the **local courts**, which are the courts operating within specific territorial jurisdictions. These local courts are divided into three levels:

1. **Basic People's Courts**: These are the courts of first instance, where most cases are initially heard. When individuals have a legal dispute, they typically start at the basic court level.

2. **Intermediate People's Courts**: These courts function primarily as courts of appeal, reviewing decisions from the basic courts. They handle cases that require a higher level of judicial scrutiny or appeals from lower court rulings.

3. **Higher People's Courts**: While not equivalent to the Supreme Court, these courts are the highest judicial authority within the local jurisdictions (provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities). They oversee certain significant cases and can review and reform decisions made by lower courts. After a decision by the Higher People's Court, it is possible to appeal to the Supreme People's Court for further review.

In this three-tiered local court system, the Intermediate People's Court acts as an appellate body, and the Higher People's Court addresses more complex cases and higher-level appeals. Judges in these local courts are appointed by the corresponding local People's Congresses.

The third category of courts in China consists of special courts. Special courts are courts that do not handle general legal matters but are responsible for specific types of cases. For example, there are special courts dedicated to intellectual property, so when cases involve intellectual property disputes, they are brought before these specialized courts rather than the general courts. Similarly, financial courts focus on financial and commercial cases.

> Other examples of special courts include military courts, which handle matters involving military personnel, and maritime courts, which deal with maritime and shipping disputes.

#### Chambers

Both the Supreme People's Court and local courts in China are organized into specialized divisions known as chambers. Each chamber focuses on specific types of cases, such as **criminal**, **civil**, **administrative**, or **economic** matters. A chamber is essentially a section within the court that handles a particular category of legal affairs. This means that not all judges in the court adjudicate every case; instead, cases are assigned to the appropriate chamber staffed by judges with expertise in that area of law.

Previously, we mentioned that there are four chambers within the court system. One of these chambers specializes in economic matters, which include commercial law and business law. Although contracts are generally considered part of civil law, in the Chinese legal system there is not a clear division between civil contracts and commercial contracts. For example, in the French legal system, there are two different codes: the Civil Code and the Commercial Code. Contracts can be classified as civil contracts—for instance, when you rent an apartment or purchase a car, these are considered civil contracts. On the other hand, commercial contracts in French law are those involving transactions between two professionals or traders.In civil contracts, the parties are typically private individuals who are not professionals or traders specialized in the relevant field. In the Chinese legal system, this distinction does not really exist because the Civil Code encompasses all types of contracts. However, the Supreme People's Court has effectively developed what could be called a business law system by recognizing specific characteristics of contracts between professionals. Even though these specificities are not codified in a separate Commercial Code or Trade Code and are instead found within the Civil Code, they result not directly from statutory law but from the interpretation of the law by the Supreme People's Court.

Additionally, there is an Administrative Chamber within the courts. The Administrative Chamber is responsible for the application of administrative law, encompassing all the rules enforced by national and local public bodies. This highlights a specific aspect of the Chinese legal system. As previously mentioned, the Chinese legal system is inspired by the continental law system, which is characterized by codified laws. In the continental legal tradition, there is a specific conception of the separation of powers, with two distinct judicial bodies: one for private law (judicial courts) and one for public law (administrative courts). Traditionally, this means there are separate judicial systems for private and public law matters. In the traditional continental system, it is uncommon to have an administrative law chamber within a general court. However, this is the case in China. Chinese courts are general in their jurisdiction, and even though they are divided into specialized entities like chambers, one of these chambers specifically handles administrative cases. These cases involve decisions made by administrative bodies and the application of public law rather than private law. This integration of administrative law within the general court system is a distinctive feature of the Chinese legal system.

In addition, some courts may have other specialized chambers, depending on their organizational structure. For example, certain courts may include an environmental chamber or, in some provinces, an environmental court dedicated to environmental matters. Similarly, this applies to social law, which encompasses two main areas: on one hand, social welfare, involving the system of public insurance, and on the other hand, labor law, concerning the rights and duties of workers and the specifics of contracts between employees and employers. Therefore, there are courts that have specific chambers dedicated to these areas of law.

#### Judgement committee

In each court, there is a body called the Judgment Committee. This committee comprises the President, the Vice President, and some magistrates—not all magistrates, but a selected group who sit on this committee. The Judgment Committee has two main duties.

The first duty of the Judgment Committee is to examine the possibility of revising a judgment. This occurs when new evidence emerges after a court has rendered its decision. In such cases, the committee must assess the situation: Should they reopen the case and re-examine it because of the new information that was not available at the time of the original decision? Or should they determine that these new elements are not significant enough to alter the outcome of the prior judgment? This examination is called a revision because, if they decide to proceed, it involves reopening the case and conducting a new trial. Therefore, in each court, the Judgment Committee is responsible for reviewing all requests for the reopening of trials.

The second duty of the judgment committee is to receive and examine case files and assign them to the appropriate judges within the different chambers. It functions as a sort of selection committee. The committee reviews the files to ensure that all necessary documents are included for adjudication. If any documents are missing, it requests the barristers to provide the missing elements. The committee also decides whether the case should be assigned to the civil chamber, the criminal chamber, or another appropriate chamber. The judicial committee is an internal body within the court and is composed of the president, the vice president, and several magistrates drawn from different chambers.

> > Question: So each chamber is kind of like a judgment committee?
>
> No, the Judgment Committee operates at the level of the entire court. This includes the Supreme People's Court, Basic People's Courts, Intermediate People's Courts, Higher People's Courts, and Special Courts. In each court, there is a president and a vice president who handle the administration of the tribunal. Within each court, the Judgment Committee is composed of the president, vice president, and some magistrates—not all magistrates. When all magistrates convene, it is called a General Assembly, which meets for various purposes.
>
> The Judgment Committee consists of select magistrates, typically the senior members of the court, representing the different chambers—such as civil, criminal, and others. When they examine and select case files, they determine the assignment of cases to specific judges or chambers. This process is conducted at the level of the entire court, not within individual chamber

#### Procurators

In the Chinese legal system, there are prosecutors known as People's Procurators. These procurators are responsible for initiating legal proceedings, especially in criminal trials. They decide whether or not to prosecute individuals and oversee all procedural aspects of a case. At the criminal level, prosecutors serve as a crucial link between the police system and the judiciary. They collaborate with the police during investigations and are responsible for bringing charges against individuals in criminal cases.

The People's Procurators also play a vital role in defending the public interest. When offenses against public welfare occur, they are tasked with protecting that interest by pursuing legal action. They have the authority to request that individuals be detained or arrested during the investigation phase. Prosecutors examine cases to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with prosecution. This means that it is the prosecutor who decides whether someone should be arrested before and during the trial process. Therefore, prosecutors hold a very important duty within the Chinese legal system.

## Different branches of law in China

### Civil law

Civil law is the most important branch of law in China. In this respect, the situation is similar to that in other continental legal systems because civil law serves as the general law. This means that if there is no specific statute or code applicable to a particular situation, the provisions of civil law will apply. Thus, civil law functions as the general framework intended to be applied universally. This is also the case in all continental legal systems, which is why civil law is considered the most important branch of law.

The Chinese civil law system was initially influenced by the French legal system, particularly the French Civil Code, but even more so by the German legal system. As you may recall, when we were studying the continental law system, I mentioned that the introduction of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), the German Civil Code of 1900, represented a revolutionary new conception of civil law in many countries. Many nations, including France, sought to draw inspiration from this new BGB. Therefore, the Chinese legal system is significantly influenced by the German legal system. However, it is important to note that the Chinese civil law system, particularly the Chinese Civil Code, is highly original. While it was initially influenced by foreign legal systems, the Chinese Civil Code is not merely a copy or adaptation of these foreign models. Instead, it reflects China's unique legal traditions and specific societal needs, making it a distinctive and original legal framework.

#### Civil code

The Chinese Civil Code comprises 1,260 articles divided into seven parts. Many legal scholars and observers regard it as more of an encyclopedia than a traditional code. This is because the code contains extensive chapters that not only affirm legal principles or provide definitions but also offer detailed analyses of their implications. Following the statement of the law, the code presents comprehensive discussions of the consequences and applications of these principles. In essence, the Chinese Civil Code integrates explanatory material—similar to what might typically be found in legal commentaries—directly into the legal text. Unlike in some legal systems where the legal text is confined to the articles themselves and additional explanations are provided by scholars separately, the Chinese Civil Code includes these elaborations as part of the official legal document. This approach means that the legal text encompasses not only the articles with their definitions and provisions but also the subsequent explanations and examples. For instance, after defining a legal concept, the code may provide illustrative examples to clarify its application. This method resembles the structure of legal texts that include commentaries, although in the Chinese Civil Code, these explanatory sections are an integral part of the law itself.

The Chinese approach differs significantly from the traditional conception of continental law. Traditionally, in continental legal systems, codes are presented with articles that are intended to be short and very precise. I should say 'were intended' because, for example, when we look at the current French Civil Code, we sometimes find very long articles with extensive explanations. The traditional system favored concise and precise articles, but this is not the case in China, and not always the case in France either. This is likely because nowadays we are addressing new subjects and elements that require detailed explanations, leading to longer articles.

The Chinese Civil Code is divided into seven parts. The first part is titled **General Provisions**, similar to the approach in the German Civil Code. In the General Provisions, the code offers a comprehensive overview of civil law, including definitions and explanations of its general purpose. For example, it defines the legal status of individuals, provides an introduction to family law—explaining what constitutes a family and the relationships between parents and children—and presents the concept of contracts.

Following the General Provisions, the second part covers **Property Rights**, detailing the laws related to ownership and property transactions. The third part addresses **Contracts**, outlining the rules governing contractual agreements between parties.

The fourth part is dedicated to **Personality Rights**, which exist in many legal systems. Personality Rights concern the rights inherent to individuals, such as the right to life, health, name, reputation, honor, privacy, and personal information. This section defines what constitutes an individual and outlines the rights and obligations individuals have within society. Unlike human rights—which are generally proclaimed in the Constitution and focus on general liberties—Personality Rights in the Civil Code specify the legal rights individuals enjoy in civil matters, such as the right to own property and enter into contracts.

The fifth part focuses on **Marriage and Family**, primarily dealing with laws related to marriage, divorce, and family relationships. The sixth part covers **Inheritance Law**, addressing the transfer of property and assets within families after death. The final part deals with **Tort Liability**, encompassing civil responsibility and the laws related to torts, including the obligations arising from harm caused to others.

#### Contract law

As previously mentioned, in the Chinese legal system, the Civil Code provides a general framework and presentation of contract law without distinguishing between civil contracts and commercial contracts. Unlike legal systems that separate civil contracts (agreements between private individuals) from commercial contracts (agreements between professionals or traders), the Chinese Civil Code encompasses all types of contracts within a single, unified approach.

In France, there is a significant distinction in contract law between civil contracts and commercial contracts. Some aspects of contract law are included within the Civil Code, and when disputes arise under these contracts, they are adjudicated by civil law judges. Civil contracts are agreements made between ordinary citizens—that is, non-professionals. For example, when renting an apartment, both the landlord and the tenant are typically not real estate professionals; thus, this constitutes a civil contract. In France, there is special protection for tenants under civil law contracts. Conversely, the French legal system also has a Commercial Code, which governs business law and applies to specific contracts made between professionals. These commercial contracts are agreements between traders or business professionals. Specific rules apply to these contracts, particularly regarding the duty of information and disclosure. When a contract is made between two professionals, it is presumed that both parties possess expertise and knowledge about the quality and specifications of the product or service that is the subject of the contract.

When a civil contract is made between two private individuals or between a private individual and a professional, the private individual is not expected to possess all the technical information. Therefore, one of the main differences between a commercial contract and a civil contract is that, within a civil contract, special protections are afforded to the buyer because they are not a professional and may not lack the necessary technical knowledge. This means the professional has an obligation to provide this information to the buyer and must act honestly toward their client. In contracts between two professionals, there are still obligations to disclose information, but they are less stringent because it is assumed that each party possesses some knowledge about the general qualities of the product or service. For example, in the French legal system, there is a clear distinction between the civil contract system and the commercial contract system between professionals, which is essentially a matter of business law.

In China, this distinction does not exist. All contracts, whether between private individuals or professionals, are considered civil contracts, and the entire legal framework governing contracts is encompassed within the civil law.

Another significant difference from the French continental legal system is the structure of contract law within the French Civil Code, which is divided into two main parts. The first part presents the general theory of obligations, known in French as **"la théorie des obligations"**. In this context, an obligation refers to a legal duty arising from a contract. When parties sign a contract, they are obligated to fulfill the terms specified within it; hence, the emphasis on obligations. This section provides a comprehensive overview of what constitutes a contract, outlining the main characteristics and the legal consequences of entering into contractual agreements. It offers an extensive explanation of what it means to be legally bound and details the elements a judge must examine to ensure that a contract is fair and that the parties involved were clearly informed of all their obligations at the time of signing. The second part of the contract law section in the French Civil Code systematically presents various types of contracts. This includes contracts for leasing, sales, banking activities, insurance, and so on. Each contract type is addressed step by step, providing specific provisions applicable to that particular kind of agreement. Notably, employment contracts are no longer included in the Civil Code; they are now governed by the Labor Code in France.

Therefore, the French system comprises a general framework in the first part, followed by detailed illustrations and regulations for each kind of contract in the second part, resulting in an extensive list of contracts covered by the code. For example, there is a type of contract known in French as **"le contrat de vente à l'essai"**, which translates to **"a sale on approval"** or **"sale on trial"** contract in English. In such agreements, the buyer has the right to test or examine the goods before the purchase becomes binding. One essential element of this contract is that the buyer must be able to assess the product to determine its qualities and suitability. For instance, if someone wishes to purchase wine, they have the right to taste it to decide if it meets their expectations. The contractual obligation becomes definitive only after the buyer has approved the product following the tasting. This principle applies similarly when purchasing items like olive oil, vinegar, or other consumable goods. The Civil Code includes specific articles addressing this particular type of contract, ensuring that buyers have the opportunity to evaluate the goods before being legally bound by the agreement.

In the Chinese legal system, while there is a definition of what constitutes a contract, there is not an extensive application of a general theory of obligations as seen in the French system. Instead, the Chinese Civil Code provides direct definitions for various specific types of contracts, such as contracts for sale, transportation, purchase, travel, banking, insurance, and other activities. The Chinese approach is more concrete and pragmatic, focusing on the specific types of contracts that exist within general commercial activities and legal relationships. The emphasis is on directly addressing the practical aspects of these contracts rather than developing a general theoretical framework to be applied to specific cases. As mentioned earlier, judges, particularly those in the Supreme People's Court, have through their interpretations—case by case and file by file—recognized certain specificities in business-related contracts. Although the Civil Code does not officially distinguish contracts in trading operations between professionals, judicial interpretations have acknowledged these distinctions. Therefore, even though there is only a general category of contracts in the legal text, there is now recognition of specific traits and unique characteristics in contracts involving business transactions between professionals.

Another specific aspect of contract law in China concerns the interpretation of contracts. According to the Civil Code, in cases of ambiguity regarding a contract of a certain type, the contract must be executed in accordance with the mandatory standards set by the state—that is, the government. This means that when interpreting a contract, one must adopt the interpretation that aligns with the general standards established by the government, particularly those related to the overall organization of the country's economic system. For example, if executing a contract would lead to illegal consequences, it must be performed in a way that ensures legality. If there are two possible interpretations—one legal and one illegal according to government standards—the interpretation that conforms to the government's standards must be chosen. Consequently, the freedom of contract is limited by the state's mandatory standards. Given that China's social organization is of a Marxist nature, one can imagine the contradictions that may arise between the application of contracts based on the theory of freedom of contracting and economic freedom, and the application of the standards of a Marxist and communist society.

#### Family law

Regarding this point, the articles about family in the code are not extensive and provide general guidelines about the family. For example, Article 1043 defines the family as an institution that should create the general conditions for promoting daily harmony, fostering family values, and contributing to the development of these values.

> Article 1043
>
> Families shall establish good family values, promote family virtues, and enhance family civility.
>
> Husband and wife shall be loyal to each other, respect each other, and care for each other. Family members shall respect the elderly, take care of the young, help each other, and maintain a marital and familial relationship of equality, harmony, and civility.

Thus, we can observe that the family is assigned a significant role in the Chinese legal system. The family is not merely considered a social organization among individuals; it also has a mission to contribute to the general harmony and daily harmony within society. In this context, the family is regarded as one of the most important institutions in the country and the state, serving as a major pillar of social stability.

However, the challenge lies in defining what is meant by "daily harmony." While "daily" clearly refers to everyday life, "harmony" is a more abstract concept. The code does not provide a specific definition of this term, making it difficult to ascertain when a family is not contributing to harmony or how certain behaviors might fail to promote it. This lack of a precise definition introduces ambiguity in interpreting the legal expectations placed upon families regarding their role in fostering societal harmony.

One of the main elements in the Civil Code concerning family law is the regulation of marriage. Marriage is considered an administrative act in China. This means that the official ceremony is conducted before a public officer at a registry office, where the marriage is legally recorded. This is significant because, prior to the revolution, marriage was primarily a religious ceremony. After the revolution, marriage became solely an administrative act conducted by public authorities. While individuals may choose to have a religious ceremony if they wish, it takes place after the official administrative procedure and holds no legal status.

Regarding weddings, there can be specific variations in some ethnic autonomous regions with their own specific administrative systems, such as Tibet or Inner Mongolia, where certain local customs and rules are recognized. These regions may apply specific rules, including those related to marriage. For example, while the general law in China requires women to be at least 20 years old and men 22 years old to marry, in some ethnic communities, the minimum age may be lower due to traditional customs. Additionally, in certain regions, the marriage ceremony may not be limited to an administrative act. Alongside the official administrative ceremony, there may also be a traditional wedding ceremony that reflects local customs, adding a cultural layer to the process.
