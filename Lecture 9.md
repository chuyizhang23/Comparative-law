## Public institutions in China (continue)

### Political institutions (continue)

#### The president of the republic

The President of the People's Republic of China is elected by the National People's Congress. At the same time, a Vice President is elected under the same conditions. Typically, both the President and the Vice President are members of the Communist Party of China. While there are eight other legally recognized political parties in China, these parties are officially independent but operate under the leadership of the CPC and are part of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). They accept the guiding role of the Communist Party. Therefore, the system is not truly multiparty or democratic in the sense commonly understood in liberal democracies.

The President of the People's Republic of China is a principal executive authority and holds significant power. He has two main responsibilities. First, the President is the leader of diplomacy and international affairs, responsible for organizing and developing China's relationships with other countries. Second, he oversees emergency situations, holding powers related to national defense and leading the response during such times. Additionally, he has the authority to submit legislative proposals to the National People's Congress. While the National People's Congress holds legislative power, the President possesses the initiative to propose laws to the Parliament.

#### the Council of State Affairs

The State Council, or Council of State Affairs, is essentially the national government of China. It is led by the Premier (Prime Minister) and the Vice Premiers, and all ministers are members of this council. The main task of the State Council is to oversee the administration of the country. It functions as an executive office, responsible for implementing the decisions made by the National People's Congress (the legislative branch) and the President (the executive branch).

Remember that because China is governed by principles of communism, there is always a parallel structure between the Communist Party and the various levels of the parliament and administration. In reality, the President of the People's Republic is not only the head of state but also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. Other officials likewise hold leadership positions within the Communist Party at lower ranks. This results in a highly centralized system where the core of administration is centered around the President, who maintains relationships with both the legislative body—the National People's Congress—and the executive body—the State Council.

In reality, a similar system exists at the provincial level. In the provinces, there is a local parliament called the Local People's Congress. The Local People's Congress elects the governor of the province or the mayor of the municipality. As previously mentioned, there are various levels of administration. The Local People's Congress is responsible for electing the governor and vice governor (or mayor and vice mayor, in the case of municipalities). There is also an executive body—not called the State Council, of course—but the Provincial People's Government, which serves as the local government with provincial ministers. The distribution of competencies mirrors that at the national level, with the government responsible for leading all administrative activities.

### The organization of justice

#### Courts

In China, the judicial system is organized into three main categories of courts:

> 1. **The Supreme People's Court**: This is the highest judicial authority in China, responsible for supervising the administration of justice by all subordinate courts.
>
> 2. **Local People's Courts**: These general trial courts are divided into three levels:
>    - **Higher People's Courts** at the provincial level.
>    - **Intermediate People's Courts** at the prefecture or municipal level.
>    - **Basic People's Courts** at the county or district level.
>
> 3. **Special People's Courts**: These courts handle specialized cases and include:
>    - **Military Courts**: Deal with matters involving military personnel.
>    - **Maritime Courts**: Handle maritime and shipping disputes.
>    - **Railway Transport Courts**: Address cases related to railway transportation.
>    - **Forestry Courts**: Focus on cases involving forestry and environmental issues.

Firstly, there is the Supreme People's Court, which is equivalent to the Supreme Court in the United States in terms of being the highest judicial authority. However, its competencies differ due to the distinct nature of China's legal system. The Supreme People's Court is responsible for establishing procedural rules and for reviewing and revising judgments issued by lower courts. Additionally, it oversees the administrative supervision of other courts. In other words, the Supreme People's Court functions both as a court of appeal and as an oversight body that controls the administration of justice. This means it possesses both judicial authority and administrative responsibilities related to supervision.

At the second level, we have the **local courts**, which are the courts operating within specific territorial jurisdictions. These local courts are divided into three levels:

1. **Basic People's Courts**: These are the courts of first instance, where most cases are initially heard. When individuals have a legal dispute, they typically start at the basic court level.

2. **Intermediate People's Courts**: These courts function primarily as courts of appeal, reviewing decisions from the basic courts. They handle cases that require a higher level of judicial scrutiny or appeals from lower court rulings.

3. **Higher People's Courts**: While not equivalent to the Supreme Court, these courts are the highest judicial authority within the local jurisdictions (provinces, autonomous regions, or municipalities). They oversee certain significant cases and can review and reform decisions made by lower courts. After a decision by the Higher People's Court, it is possible to appeal to the Supreme People's Court for further review.

In this three-tiered local court system, the Intermediate People's Court acts as an appellate body, and the Higher People's Court addresses more complex cases and higher-level appeals. Judges in these local courts are appointed by the corresponding local People's Congresses.

The third category of courts in China consists of special courts. Special courts are courts that do not handle general legal matters but are responsible for specific types of cases. For example, there are special courts dedicated to intellectual property, so when cases involve intellectual property disputes, they are brought before these specialized courts rather than the general courts. Similarly, financial courts focus on financial and commercial cases.

> Other examples of special courts include military courts, which handle matters involving military personnel, and maritime courts, which deal with maritime and shipping disputes.

#### Chambers

Both the Supreme People's Court and local courts in China are organized into specialized divisions known as chambers. Each chamber focuses on specific types of cases, such as **criminal**, **civil**, **administrative**, or **economic** matters. A chamber is essentially a section within the court that handles a particular category of legal affairs. This means that not all judges in the court adjudicate every case; instead, cases are assigned to the appropriate chamber staffed by judges with expertise in that area of law.

Previously, we mentioned that there are four chambers within the court system. One of these chambers specializes in economic matters, which include commercial law and business law. Although contracts are generally considered part of civil law, in the Chinese legal system there is not a clear division between civil contracts and commercial contracts. For example, in the French legal system, there are two different codes: the Civil Code and the Commercial Code. Contracts can be classified as civil contracts—for instance, when you rent an apartment or purchase a car, these are considered civil contracts. On the other hand, commercial contracts in French law are those involving transactions between two professionals or traders.In civil contracts, the parties are typically private individuals who are not professionals or traders specialized in the relevant field. In the Chinese legal system, this distinction does not really exist because the Civil Code encompasses all types of contracts. However, the Supreme People's Court has effectively developed what could be called a business law system by recognizing specific characteristics of contracts between professionals. Even though these specificities are not codified in a separate Commercial Code or Trade Code and are instead found within the Civil Code, they result not directly from statutory law but from the interpretation of the law by the Supreme People's Court.

Additionally, there is an Administrative Chamber within the courts. The Administrative Chamber is responsible for the application of administrative law, encompassing all the rules enforced by national and local public bodies. This highlights a specific aspect of the Chinese legal system. As previously mentioned, the Chinese legal system is inspired by the continental law system, which is characterized by codified laws. In the continental legal tradition, there is a specific conception of the separation of powers, with two distinct judicial bodies: one for private law (judicial courts) and one for public law (administrative courts). Traditionally, this means there are separate judicial systems for private and public law matters. In the traditional continental system, it is uncommon to have an administrative law chamber within a general court. However, this is the case in China. Chinese courts are general in their jurisdiction, and even though they are divided into specialized entities like chambers, one of these chambers specifically handles administrative cases. These cases involve decisions made by administrative bodies and the application of public law rather than private law. This integration of administrative law within the general court system is a distinctive feature of the Chinese legal system.

In addition, some courts may have other specialized chambers, depending on their organizational structure. For example, certain courts may include an environmental chamber or, in some provinces, an environmental court dedicated to environmental matters. Similarly, this applies to social law, which encompasses two main areas: on one hand, social welfare, involving the system of public insurance, and on the other hand, labor law, concerning the rights and duties of workers and the specifics of contracts between employees and employers. Therefore, there are courts that have specific chambers dedicated to these areas of law.

#### Judgement committee

In each court, there is a body called the Judgment Committee. This committee comprises the President, the Vice President, and some magistrates—not all magistrates, but a selected group who sit on this committee. The Judgment Committee has two main duties.

The first duty of the Judgment Committee is to examine the possibility of revising a judgment. This occurs when new evidence emerges after a court has rendered its decision. In such cases, the committee must assess the situation: Should they reopen the case and re-examine it because of the new information that was not available at the time of the original decision? Or should they determine that these new elements are not significant enough to alter the outcome of the prior judgment? This examination is called a revision because, if they decide to proceed, it involves reopening the case and conducting a new trial. Therefore, in each court, the Judgment Committee is responsible for reviewing all requests for the reopening of trials.

The second duty of the judgment committee is to receive and examine case files and assign them to the appropriate judges within the different chambers. It functions as a sort of selection committee. The committee reviews the files to ensure that all necessary documents are included for adjudication. If any documents are missing, it requests the barristers to provide the missing elements. The committee also decides whether the case should be assigned to the civil chamber, the criminal chamber, or another appropriate chamber. The judicial committee is an internal body within the court and is composed of the president, the vice president, and several magistrates drawn from different chambers.

> > Question: So each chamber is kind of like a judgment committee?
>
> No, the Judgment Committee operates at the level of the entire court. This includes the Supreme People's Court, Basic People's Courts, Intermediate People's Courts, Higher People's Courts, and Special Courts. In each court, there is a president and a vice president who handle the administration of the tribunal. Within each court, the Judgment Committee is composed of the president, vice president, and some magistrates—not all magistrates. When all magistrates convene, it is called a General Assembly, which meets for various purposes.
>
> The Judgment Committee consists of select magistrates, typically the senior members of the court, representing the different chambers—such as civil, criminal, and others. When they examine and select case files, they determine the assignment of cases to specific judges or chambers. This process is conducted at the level of the entire court, not within individual chamber

#### Procurators

In the Chinese legal system, there are prosecutors known as People's Procurators. These procurators are responsible for initiating legal proceedings, especially in criminal trials. They decide whether or not to prosecute individuals and oversee all procedural aspects of a case. At the criminal level, prosecutors serve as a crucial link between the police system and the judiciary. They collaborate with the police during investigations and are responsible for bringing charges against individuals in criminal cases.

The People's Procurators also play a vital role in defending the public interest. When offenses against public welfare occur, they are tasked with protecting that interest by pursuing legal action. They have the authority to request that individuals be detained or arrested during the investigation phase. Prosecutors examine cases to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with prosecution. This means that it is the prosecutor who decides whether someone should be arrested before and during the trial process. Therefore, prosecutors hold a very important duty within the Chinese legal system.

## Different branches of law in China

### Civil law

Civil law is the most important branch of law in China. In this respect, the situation is similar to that in other continental legal systems because civil law serves as the general law. This means that if there is no specific statute or code applicable to a particular situation, the provisions of civil law will apply. Thus, civil law functions as the general framework intended to be applied universally. This is also the case in all continental legal systems, which is why civil law is considered the most important branch of law.

The Chinese civil law system was initially influenced by the French legal system, particularly the French Civil Code, but even more so by the German legal system. As you may recall, when we were studying the continental law system, I mentioned that the introduction of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), the German Civil Code of 1900, represented a revolutionary new conception of civil law in many countries. Many nations, including France, sought to draw inspiration from this new BGB. Therefore, the Chinese legal system is significantly influenced by the German legal system. However, it is important to note that the Chinese civil law system, particularly the Chinese Civil Code, is highly original. While it was initially influenced by foreign legal systems, the Chinese Civil Code is not merely a copy or adaptation of these foreign models. Instead, it reflects China's unique legal traditions and specific societal needs, making it a distinctive and original legal framework.

#### Civil code

The Chinese Civil Code comprises 1,260 articles divided into seven parts. Many legal scholars and observers regard it as more of an encyclopedia than a traditional code. This is because the code contains extensive chapters that not only affirm legal principles or provide definitions but also offer detailed analyses of their implications. Following the statement of the law, the code presents comprehensive discussions of the consequences and applications of these principles. In essence, the Chinese Civil Code integrates explanatory material—similar to what might typically be found in legal commentaries—directly into the legal text. Unlike in some legal systems where the legal text is confined to the articles themselves and additional explanations are provided by scholars separately, the Chinese Civil Code includes these elaborations as part of the official legal document. This approach means that the legal text encompasses not only the articles with their definitions and provisions but also the subsequent explanations and examples. For instance, after defining a legal concept, the code may provide illustrative examples to clarify its application. This method resembles the structure of legal texts that include commentaries, although in the Chinese Civil Code, these explanatory sections are an integral part of the law itself.

The Chinese approach differs significantly from the traditional conception of continental law. Traditionally, in continental legal systems, codes are presented with articles that are intended to be short and very precise. I should say 'were intended' because, for example, when we look at the current French Civil Code, we sometimes find very long articles with extensive explanations. The traditional system favored concise and precise articles, but this is not the case in China, and not always the case in France either. This is likely because nowadays we are addressing new subjects and elements that require detailed explanations, leading to longer articles.

The Chinese Civil Code is divided into seven parts. The first part is titled **General Provisions**, similar to the approach in the German Civil Code. In the General Provisions, the code offers a comprehensive overview of civil law, including definitions and explanations of its general purpose. For example, it defines the legal status of individuals, provides an introduction to family law—explaining what constitutes a family and the relationships between parents and children—and presents the concept of contracts.

Following the General Provisions, the second part covers **Property Rights**, detailing the laws related to ownership and property transactions. The third part addresses **Contracts**, outlining the rules governing contractual agreements between parties.

The fourth part is dedicated to **Personality Rights**, which exist in many legal systems. Personality Rights concern the rights inherent to individuals, such as the right to life, health, name, reputation, honor, privacy, and personal information. This section defines what constitutes an individual and outlines the rights and obligations individuals have within society. Unlike human rights—which are generally proclaimed in the Constitution and focus on general liberties—Personality Rights in the Civil Code specify the legal rights individuals enjoy in civil matters, such as the right to own property and enter into contracts.

The fifth part focuses on **Marriage and Family**, primarily dealing with laws related to marriage, divorce, and family relationships. The sixth part covers **Inheritance Law**, addressing the transfer of property and assets within families after death. The final part deals with **Tort Liability**, encompassing civil responsibility and the laws related to torts, including the obligations arising from harm caused to others.

#### Contract law

As previously mentioned, in the Chinese legal system, the Civil Code provides a general framework and presentation of contract law without distinguishing between civil contracts and commercial contracts. Unlike legal systems that separate civil contracts (agreements between private individuals) from commercial contracts (agreements between professionals or traders), the Chinese Civil Code encompasses all types of contracts within a single, unified approach.

In France, there is a significant distinction in contract law between civil contracts and commercial contracts. Some aspects of contract law are included within the Civil Code, and when disputes arise under these contracts, they are adjudicated by civil law judges. Civil contracts are agreements made between ordinary citizens—that is, non-professionals. For example, when renting an apartment, both the landlord and the tenant are typically not real estate professionals; thus, this constitutes a civil contract. In France, there is special protection for tenants under civil law contracts. Conversely, the French legal system also has a Commercial Code, which governs business law and applies to specific contracts made between professionals. These commercial contracts are agreements between traders or business professionals. Specific rules apply to these contracts, particularly regarding the duty of information and disclosure. When a contract is made between two professionals, it is presumed that both parties possess expertise and knowledge about the quality and specifications of the product or service that is the subject of the contract.

When a civil contract is made between two private individuals or between a private individual and a professional, the private individual is not expected to possess all the technical information. Therefore, one of the main differences between a commercial contract and a civil contract is that, within a civil contract, special protections are afforded to the buyer because they are not a professional and may not lack the necessary technical knowledge. This means the professional has an obligation to provide this information to the buyer and must act honestly toward their client. In contracts between two professionals, there are still obligations to disclose information, but they are less stringent because it is assumed that each party possesses some knowledge about the general qualities of the product or service. For example, in the French legal system, there is a clear distinction between the civil contract system and the commercial contract system between professionals, which is essentially a matter of business law.

In China, this distinction does not exist. All contracts, whether between private individuals or professionals, are considered civil contracts, and the entire legal framework governing contracts is encompassed within the civil law.

Another significant difference from the French continental legal system is the structure of contract law within the French Civil Code, which is divided into two main parts. The first part presents the general theory of obligations, known in French as **"la théorie des obligations"**. In this context, an obligation refers to a legal duty arising from a contract. When parties sign a contract, they are obligated to fulfill the terms specified within it; hence, the emphasis on obligations. This section provides a comprehensive overview of what constitutes a contract, outlining the main characteristics and the legal consequences of entering into contractual agreements. It offers an extensive explanation of what it means to be legally bound and details the elements a judge must examine to ensure that a contract is fair and that the parties involved were clearly informed of all their obligations at the time of signing. The second part of the contract law section in the French Civil Code systematically presents various types of contracts. This includes contracts for leasing, sales, banking activities, insurance, and so on. Each contract type is addressed step by step, providing specific provisions applicable to that particular kind of agreement. Notably, employment contracts are no longer included in the Civil Code; they are now governed by the Labor Code in France.

Therefore, the French system comprises a general framework in the first part, followed by detailed illustrations and regulations for each kind of contract in the second part, resulting in an extensive list of contracts covered by the code. For example, there is a type of contract known in French as **"le contrat de vente à l'essai"**, which translates to **"a sale on approval"** or **"sale on trial"** contract in English. In such agreements, the buyer has the right to test or examine the goods before the purchase becomes binding. One essential element of this contract is that the buyer must be able to assess the product to determine its qualities and suitability. For instance, if someone wishes to purchase wine, they have the right to taste it to decide if it meets their expectations. The contractual obligation becomes definitive only after the buyer has approved the product following the tasting. This principle applies similarly when purchasing items like olive oil, vinegar, or other consumable goods. The Civil Code includes specific articles addressing this particular type of contract, ensuring that buyers have the opportunity to evaluate the goods before being legally bound by the agreement.

In the Chinese legal system, while there is a definition of what constitutes a contract, there is not an extensive application of a general theory of obligations as seen in the French system. Instead, the Chinese Civil Code provides direct definitions for various specific types of contracts, such as contracts for sale, transportation, purchase, travel, banking, insurance, and other activities. The Chinese approach is more concrete and pragmatic, focusing on the specific types of contracts that exist within general commercial activities and legal relationships. The emphasis is on directly addressing the practical aspects of these contracts rather than developing a general theoretical framework to be applied to specific cases. As mentioned earlier, judges, particularly those in the Supreme People's Court, have through their interpretations—case by case and file by file—recognized certain specificities in business-related contracts. Although the Civil Code does not officially distinguish contracts in trading operations between professionals, judicial interpretations have acknowledged these distinctions. Therefore, even though there is only a general category of contracts in the legal text, there is now recognition of specific traits and unique characteristics in contracts involving business transactions between professionals.

Another specific aspect of contract law in China concerns the interpretation of contracts. According to the Civil Code, in cases of ambiguity regarding a contract of a certain type, the contract must be executed in accordance with the mandatory standards set by the state—that is, the government. This means that when interpreting a contract, one must adopt the interpretation that aligns with the general standards established by the government, particularly those related to the overall organization of the country's economic system. For example, if executing a contract would lead to illegal consequences, it must be performed in a way that ensures legality. If there are two possible interpretations—one legal and one illegal according to government standards—the interpretation that conforms to the government's standards must be chosen. Consequently, the freedom of contract is limited by the state's mandatory standards. Given that China's social organization is of a Marxist nature, one can imagine the contradictions that may arise between the application of contracts based on the theory of freedom of contracting and economic freedom, and the application of the standards of a Marxist and communist society.

#### Family law

Regarding this point, the articles about family in the code are not extensive and provide general guidelines about the family. For example, Article 1043 defines the family as an institution that should create the general conditions for promoting daily harmony, fostering family values, and contributing to the development of these values.

> Article 1043
>
> Families shall establish good family values, promote family virtues, and enhance family civility.
>
> Husband and wife shall be loyal to each other, respect each other, and care for each other. Family members shall respect the elderly, take care of the young, help each other, and maintain a marital and familial relationship of equality, harmony, and civility.

Thus, we can observe that the family is assigned a significant role in the Chinese legal system. The family is not merely considered a social organization among individuals; it also has a mission to contribute to the general harmony and daily harmony within society. In this context, the family is regarded as one of the most important institutions in the country and the state, serving as a major pillar of social stability.

However, the challenge lies in defining what is meant by "daily harmony." While "daily" clearly refers to everyday life, "harmony" is a more abstract concept. The code does not provide a specific definition of this term, making it difficult to ascertain when a family is not contributing to harmony or how certain behaviors might fail to promote it. This lack of a precise definition introduces ambiguity in interpreting the legal expectations placed upon families regarding their role in fostering societal harmony.

One of the main elements in the Civil Code concerning family law is the regulation of marriage. Marriage is considered an administrative act in China. This means that the official ceremony is conducted before a public officer at a registry office, where the marriage is legally recorded. This is significant because, prior to the revolution, marriage was primarily a religious ceremony. After the revolution, marriage became solely an administrative act conducted by public authorities. While individuals may choose to have a religious ceremony if they wish, it takes place after the official administrative procedure and holds no legal status.

Regarding weddings, there can be specific variations in some ethnic autonomous regions with their own specific administrative systems, such as Tibet or Inner Mongolia, where certain local customs and rules are recognized. These regions may apply specific rules, including those related to marriage. For example, while the general law in China requires women to be at least 20 years old and men 22 years old to marry, in some ethnic communities, the minimum age may be lower due to traditional customs. Additionally, in certain regions, the marriage ceremony may not be limited to an administrative act. Alongside the official administrative ceremony, there may also be a traditional wedding ceremony that reflects local customs, adding a cultural layer to the process.

In family law, there is a fundamental principle of strict equality between the husband and wife, or between the spouses in general. This means that both partners have equal rights and responsibilities within the marriage. The marriage is governed by three key principles:

1. **Respect**: Spouses are required to respect each other, ensuring mutual regard and consideration within the relationship.
2. **Fidelity**: There is a clear expectation of loyalty, meaning that extramarital affairs are not permitted.
3. **Love**: The relationship between the spouses is also expected to be based on love, emphasizing the emotional connection within the marriage.

Within family law, there are also provisions concerning the situation of children. For decades, China implemented the one-child policy as an official measure to control population growth. This policy limited most families to having only one child. However, in 2021, a new law was passed allowing families to have up to three children, replacing the previous restriction.

Also within the family law system, divorce is legally permitted in China. Either the husband or the wife can initiate a divorce, reflecting the principle of equality between the spouses mentioned earlier. This ensures that both parties have the same legal rights to seek a divorce if they choose to do so.

### Social law

In social law, two main areas are addressed. On one hand, there is social welfare, which encompasses public insurance systems for health, retirement, and other social protections. One of the key characteristics of the Chinese system is the distinction between urban and rural areas, resulting in different organizational structures, processes, and benefit amounts for social welfare.

Within this social welfare system, there are two components:

1. **Public protection** provided either by the state or employers.
2. **Individual protection**, where individuals contribute additional payments for complementary coverage beyond what is provided by the public system.

This dual structure reflects the differences in coverage and benefits based on the individual's location and the specific protections available to them.

The second aspect of social law is labor law. One of the main characteristics of the labor law system in China is the presence of specific provisions related to employment contracts. These provisions govern the relationship between the worker and the employer, whether the employer is a public entity or a private company.

In cases of disputes between a worker and their employer, there are several options for resolution. The first step often involves **mediation**, which can occur at two levels:

1. **Mediation within the enterprise**, where the issue is addressed internally between the worker and employer.
2. **Mediation at the local public level**, where a public administrative body in the local area facilitates the resolution.

If mediation fails at either level, the case can then proceed to a trial in front of the **specialized labor courts** mentioned earlier. These courts are dedicated to resolving labor-related disputes.

One of the key aspects of labor law in China is the issue of strikes. Officially, the right to strike is not prohibited, but in practice, strikes and demonstrations are often treated as illegal. Organizing or participating in non-official protests or strikes can lead to legal prosecution. This contrasts with labor laws in many Western countries, where workers have the proclaimed right to strike or halt work to demand negotiations, and this right is generally protected by law.

In China, however, strikes are more complicated. While the right to strike exists on paper, in practice, it is heavily restricted. Demonstrations and strikes—whether in public or private sectors—can be subject to prosecution by authorities at various levels of government. This reflects a broader characteristic of the Marxist system, where, despite the official recognition of certain rights (such as the right to strike), exercising these rights can be seen as opposing the government. This was a common feature in other Marxist countries like the former USSR, where the right to strike was recognized but not practically allowed, as it was often interpreted as a challenge to state authority.

### Environmental law

#### Constitution

This is, of course, a very contemporary issue. In the Chinese Constitution, there is a strong proclamation regarding the importance of environmental protection. The Constitution states that the state has the obligation to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources. Furthermore, it mandates that the state must promote the sustainable management and conservation of these resources, reflecting a commitment to environmental sustainability at the national level.

The Chinese Constitution also emphasizes the protection of various aspects of nature, including natural and traditional landscapes. This means the state is obligated not to make sweeping changes to the land but to protect certain natural areas and traditional cultural sites. For example, landscapes that are deeply connected to Chinese civilization and heritage must be preserved. The state has a responsibility to ensure that such areas are not destroyed.

The Chinese Constitution also includes a general principle of environmental protection, encompassing the protection of nature and biodiversity. This extends to the protection of animals and various types of plant species. In essence, the Constitution clearly proclaims the state's duty to safeguard the environment, emphasizing the importance of preserving the natural world and its diverse ecosystems.

The Chinese Constitution also affirms the right of the people to access information about the state of the environment in the country. This is significant because it implies that the state's obligation goes beyond merely proclaiming environmental protection—it must also take concrete actions to implement it. Additionally, this right to information means that citizens, as well as organizations such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and associations, have the legal right to be informed about environmental conditions.

It's important to note that this principle, as written in the Chinese Constitution, must be understood within the context of a Marxist state. In such a state, there is not necessarily a guaranteed freedom for citizens to hold demonstrations, openly criticize the government, or demand information from authorities. While the Constitution's provision on environmental information may appear liberal from a political standpoint, the reality is shaped by the monopoly of the Communist Party in defining the country's direction. As a result, individuals or organizations that contest government policies on environmental issues or demand information that the administration is not willing to provide may face repercussions. In some cases, this could be seen as an offense against the state. The actual application of this principle can vary, depending on local implementation and the directives of the central government. In essence, while the Constitution presents a liberal framework on paper, its application by the authorities may be much more restrictive.

#### International treaties

A second important point is that China has signed various international treaties focused on the protection of nature and sustainable development. For example, China is a signatory to the Paris Agreement (COP 21), an international treaty that sets objectives for countries regarding sustainable development and environmental protection, particularly in terms of reducing emissions and promoting greener production methods. China has officially committed to implementing these international agreements.

> **Paris Agreement (COP21)**
>
> The **Paris Agreement** is a landmark international treaty adopted on December 12, 2015, during the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Paris, France. It represents a global commitment to combat climate change by limiting global warming and enhancing the ability of countries to deal with its impacts.

Addressing the existing challenges and bridging the ambition gap are essential for achieving the agreement's long-term objectives and ensuring a sustainable future for the planet.

However, many private international organizations have raised concerns about the significant pollution issues in certain parts of China, particularly related to industrial development. Despite the proclamation of these environmental principles and commitments, there are ongoing challenges in fully aligning industrial practices with the goals set by these treaties.

Since 2019, there has been a project to draft a specific Environmental Code in China. Currently, the parliament is reviewing this project through its various commissions, with ongoing discussions between the government and parliament to finalize the code. One of the key issues is how to integrate international environmental protection principles into this new code. As mentioned earlier, China has signed numerous international treaties on sustainable development, environmental protection, and climate change. The challenge now is to incorporate these international commitments into domestic law.

> China has established a comprehensive **Environmental Protection Law (EPL)**, which functions as the country's primary environmental code. This law was significantly revised and officially took effect on January 1, 2023. The EPL consolidates various existing environmental regulations into a unified framework to better address environmental challenges and promote sustainable development.
>
> **Key Features of China's Environmental Protection Law**
>
> 1. **Comprehensive Coverage:**
>    - **Pollution Control:** Regulations on air, water, soil pollution, and waste management.
>    - **Conservation:** Protection of biodiversity, ecosystems, and natural resources.
>    - **Climate Change:** Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy.
>
> 2. **State Obligations:**
>    - **Active Protection:** The government is required to take concrete actions to protect the environment, not just declare intentions.
>    - **Environmental Information:** Ensures public access to environmental data, empowering citizens and organizations to participate in environmental governance.
>
> 3. **Public Participation:**
>    - **Transparency:** Citizens, NGOs, and associations have the right to obtain information about environmental conditions.
>    - **Consultation:** Involvement of the public in decision-making processes related to environmental policies and projects.
>
> 4. **Enforcement and Accountability:**
>    - **Stricter Penalties:** Increased fines and sanctions for environmental violations.
>    - **Polluter Pays Principle:** Those causing pollution are responsible for remediation and compensation.
>
> 5. **Integration with Other Laws:**
>    - **Unified Framework:** Combines over 30 existing environmental laws and regulations into a single, coherent legal structure.
>
> **Importance of the Environmental Protection Law**
>
> - **Enhanced Legal Framework:** Provides a robust basis for environmental protection and sustainable development in China.
> - **Increased Transparency:** Facilitates greater public oversight and participation in environmental matters.
> - **Stronger Enforcement:** Improves the government's ability to enforce environmental regulations and hold violators accountable.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> China's **Environmental Protection Law** serves as a comprehensive environmental code, reinforcing the nation's commitment to addressing environmental issues through unified legislation, increased transparency, and active public participation. This law marks a significant step towards more effective environmental governance and sustainable development in China.

China has considerable experience with this process, particularly in the realm of economic law. For instance, China has signed many international treaties related to trade and economy, such as those under the World Trade Organization. In response, the Chinese parliament has successfully incorporated these international principles into national business law. It is likely that the Chinese parliament will adopt a similar approach when drafting the Environmental Code.

The key question, in fact, is determining the true legal character of international environmental law. For example, some argue that environmental agreements—especially the Paris Agreement (COP21)—impose binding legal obligations on states, meaning that countries must respect and enforce the provisions outlined in these treaties. In this view, the commitments made under such agreements are mandatory, requiring concrete action from the signatory states.

On the other hand, some believe that these international texts are not truly normative, but rather establish general objectives that states are encouraged to pursue, without absolute legal obligation. This was notably the stance of the U.S. government under President Donald Trump. Upon taking office, one of Trump's first decisions was to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, signaling that the U.S. would not enforce the treaty’s provisions. When Joe Biden was elected, he reversed this decision and rejoined the Paris Agreement, though challenges remained, such as the issue of gas exploitation. This debate illustrates the uncertainty surrounding whether international environmental agreements are legally binding or merely aspirational targets that states are expected, but not obligated, to achieve.

This uncertainty is at the heart of the current debate in China as well. It is still unclear what China’s official stance is on the legal nature of these environmental treaties. While many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have criticized China for not fully implementing the commitments outlined in such agreements, the ongoing discussion in the Chinese parliament revolves around this very issue: Is international environmental law a set of binding norms, or merely goals that states should aim to reach without legal obligation?
