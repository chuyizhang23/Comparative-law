## Public institutions in China (continue)

### Political institutions (continue)

#### The president of the republic

The President of the People's Republic of China is elected by the National People's Congress. At the same time, a Vice President is elected under the same conditions. Typically, both the President and the Vice President are members of the Communist Party of China. While there are eight other legally recognized political parties in China, these parties are officially independent but operate under the leadership of the CPC and are part of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). They accept the guiding role of the Communist Party. Therefore, the system is not truly multiparty or democratic in the sense commonly understood in liberal democracies.

The President of the People's Republic of China is a principal executive authority and holds significant power. He has two main responsibilities. First, the President is the leader of diplomacy and international affairs, responsible for organizing and developing China's relationships with other countries. Second, he oversees emergency situations, holding powers related to national defense and leading the response during such times. Additionally, he has the authority to submit legislative proposals to the National People's Congress. While the National People's Congress holds legislative power, the President possesses the initiative to propose laws to the Parliament.

#### the Council of State Affairs

The State Council, or Council of State Affairs, is essentially the national government of China. It is led by the Premier (Prime Minister) and the Vice Premiers, and all ministers are members of this council. The main task of the State Council is to oversee the administration of the country. It functions as an executive office, responsible for implementing the decisions made by the National People's Congress (the legislative branch) and the President (the executive branch).

Remember that because China is governed by principles of communism, there is always a parallel structure between the Communist Party and the various levels of the parliament and administration. In reality, the President of the People's Republic is not only the head of state but also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. Other officials likewise hold leadership positions within the Communist Party at lower ranks. This results in a highly centralized system where the core of administration is centered around the President, who maintains relationships with both the legislative body—the National People's Congress—and the executive body—the State Council.

In reality, a similar system exists at the provincial level. In the provinces, there is a local parliament called the Local People's Congress. The Local People's Congress elects the governor of the province or the mayor of the municipality. As previously mentioned, there are various levels of administration. The Local People's Congress is responsible for electing the governor and vice governor (or mayor and vice mayor, in the case of municipalities). There is also an executive body—not called the State Council, of course—but the Provincial People's Government, which serves as the local government with provincial ministers. The distribution of competencies mirrors that at the national level, with the government responsible for leading all administrative activities.
