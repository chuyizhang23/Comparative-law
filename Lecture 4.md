## Characters of the common law system

### Customs in common law

Common law encompasses a set of principles that coexist with statutory laws and involve judges' interpretation and the application of precedents. In many areas, customs govern without the presence of written laws.

For example, **common law marriage** in the US and UK refers to a relationship between two persons living together as married people.

> ==Common law marriage== is a legal concept that recognizes a marriage between two individuals who have not obtained a marriage license or participated in a formal marriage ceremony. Instead, the marriage is considered valid based on the couple's cohabitation and public acknowledgment of their relationship as marital partners. In jurisdictions that recognize common law marriage, certain criteria must typically be met for the relationship to be legally recognized as a marriage, such as mutual consent, cohabitation, and presenting themselves to others as married. The requirements for common law marriage vary by jurisdiction, and not all states or countries recognize it.

Generally, marriage requires a formal wedding done in front of a person, which is an act that is written in law.

> In the United States, the requirement for a formal wedding ceremony to establish a legal marriage varies by state. While most states do require some form of formal solemnization, such as a ceremony conducted by an authorized officiant (such as a religious leader or a judge) in front of witnesses, the specifics of these requirements can differ.
>
> However, some states recognize common law marriage, where a formal wedding ceremony may not be necessary. In states that recognize common law marriage, couples who meet certain criteria, such as living together as spouses and holding themselves out as married, can be considered legally married without a formal ceremony.

In situations where common law marriage is recognized, the two people in common law marriage are considered in the same situation as those who are formally married. They are living together, solidarity together; there is some legal praxis.

> In essence, common law marriage recognizes that two people can be in the same legal situation as a formally married couple, even though they have not completed the formalities typically required by law to establish a marital union. Despite the absence of a formal act, common law marriage recognizes the couple's mutual intent to enter into a marital relationship and treats them as legally married for various purposes, such as property rights, inheritance, and spousal benefits.

Common law marriage is a practice that is approved and done by the court when there is no official wedding involved. It is due to the fact that in the US during the 1980s, many people lived in territories where there were no judges. These people lived together, having children, but didn't legally justify their wedding or marriage.

The underlying principle of the recognition of common law marriage is the recognition of the consensus, that the two people treat their relationship as married people instead of just two people living together.

> In jurisdictions that recognize common law marriage, couples are typically required to demonstrate their mutual intent to enter into a marital relationship and hold themselves out to others as married. This mutual consent is a key element in establishing common law marriage and reflects the principle that individuals should have the freedom to form marital relationships based on their mutual agreement, even without a formal ceremony or legal documentation. Therefore, the recognition of common law marriage can be seen as a recognition of the general consensus between the parties to establish a marital relationship.
>
> In other words, it implies that the attitudes, behaviors, and expectations commonly observed in married couples—such as mutual support, shared responsibilities, and commitment—should also be present in relationships where partners cohabit without being legally married. This perspective acknowledges that the nature of the relationship, characterized by cohabitation and mutual commitment, is more significant than the formal legal status of marriage.

With common law, consensus emerges from various legal sources, such as judicial rulings that build upon precedent. Over time, these decisions contribute to the development of an unwritten body of law.

> Consensus, in the sense of widespread agreement or acceptance among legal practitioners, scholars, and judges, is not typically considered a formal source of law in the common law system. In common law jurisdictions, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, formal sources of law primarily include statutes, case law (precedent), and legal customs. However, consensus among legal professionals and scholars may influence judicial interpretation and application of the law.

### Adaptability of common law

In common law, nothing is definitive or set in stone, as courts always have the ability to revisit and reconsider precedent.

The rule of precedent means that judges are responsible for applying the law to each case. They do this by examining legal texts, court judgments, and cases similar to the one at hand. For instance, they might look at how divorce is defined or handled when children are involved. Based on these elements, judges issue judgments, considering both statutory law and common law principles.

The common law system is highly adaptable, allowing judges to determine how to apply typical solutions for specific cases, even in the presence of precedents. Judges can either apply traditional decisions from the supreme court or high court, or opt to disregard these precedents and choose alternative solutions.

In the common law system, judges in lower courts have the flexibility to interpret customs and apply written laws in new ways when necessary to justify their decisions. They are not obligated to follow the rulings of higher courts. If parties disagree with a lower court's decision, they can appeal to a higher court to determine whether the original decision stands or if a new solution should be offered.

### Comparison to the civil law system

The common law appears to be more adaptable than continental law, which relies heavily on codes. In continental law, the idea here is to say the judge is not the maker of the law but the servant of the law. When there is a text and the whole legal system is made of codes or written text, the judge has to apply these. The adaptability of the legal system arises from the interpretation of these texts, as they can be applied to various solutions. Judges can make interpretations of the law, but not mutations of the law; they cannot give interpretations that denaturalize the law.

#### Government of judges

There is a risk that the judges are not just servants of the law but are also trying to make policies. This happens mainly in France and generally in Europe. There was an evolution in the conception of the work that the judge has about his mission.

The classical principle of the mission of judges since the French Revolution is being the servant of law, applying the law, but not misinterpreting it. From 25 to 35 years ago, some judges in continental law countries were interpreting a law as you do in the common law system. They proposed the liberation of law and judges, with large interpretations. It's a trend coming from the common law.

These judges base their judgments on statutory law and different kinds of general principles.

> In Europe, particularly in countries following the continental legal tradition like France, discussions and debates surrounding the liberation of judicial interpretation of law have been significant. One notable period for such discussions occurred during the late 20^th^ and early 21^st^ centuries, coinciding with broader debates about legal reform, the role of judges, and the balance of power between branches of government. These discussions often revolved around topics such as judicial activism, legal positivism, and the extent to which judges should have discretion in interpreting and applying laws. While there have been calls for greater judicial independence and flexibility in legal interpretation, the specifics of any movement or initiative would depend on the political and legal context of the time.

#### The situation in France

In the continental legal system, law is written law. But about 100 years ago, between the two world wars, there was a movement in the administration area of the law. The administrative judges decided to make an interpretation of rights, not only with statute law but also with references to what they call the general principle of law. The judges pick the general principles of law in terms of what they call the liberal tradition of French law.

General principles in law are not codified statutes but rather traditions and customs that judges rely on. In common law, these traditions are complemented by statutory law, creating a distinct legal framework. However, in recent years, there has been a blurring of the lines between common law and continental law practices.

Judges in continental law systems are increasingly adopting interpretations similar to those found in common law. This shift can be attributed to the need to address new societal challenges that arise after the world wars. Statutory laws often prove inadequate in addressing these novel issues, prompting judges to turn to broader interpretations and general principles. This adaptation reflects the changing landscape of legal systems as they strive to respond to evolving societal needs.

While civil law and common law systems have traditionally been distinct in their approaches to legal principles and procedures, there has been a trend toward convergence or borrowing of practices between the two systems in recent years. This can be attributed to various factors such as globalization, increased international trade, and the cross-fertilization of legal ideas through academic exchange and comparative legal studies. However, it's important to note that despite some convergence, significant differences between civil law and common law systems still exist.

> Here are some ways in which the differences between civil law and common law systems may be diminishing:
>
> 1. **Codification and Case Law**: Civil law systems are traditionally based on codified laws, while common law systems rely heavily on case law and precedent. However, some civil law jurisdictions have started to recognize the value of precedent and have incorporated elements of case law into their legal systems. Similarly, common law jurisdictions have increasingly relied on statutory codes and codification in certain areas of law.
>
> 2. **Judicial Decision-Making**: In both civil and common law systems, there has been a movement toward more rational and consistent judicial decision-making. Judges in civil law systems may consider principles of fairness and equity, while judges in common law systems may rely on statutes and legal principles more explicitly. However, judges in both systems are increasingly influenced by legal reasoning from other jurisdictions and may draw on a broader range of sources when making decisions.
>
> 3. **Legal Education and Training**: Legal education and training programs are increasingly incorporating comparative law studies, exposing students to different legal traditions and approaches. This can lead to a greater understanding and appreciation of the similarities and differences between civil law and common law systems among legal professionals.
>
> 4. **Internationalization of Law**: With the growth of international trade and investment, there has been an increased need for harmonization of legal standards and practices across different jurisdictions. International organizations and agreements often facilitate this process by promoting common legal principles and standards that transcend traditional distinctions between civil law and common law systems.
>
> 5. **Legal Reform and Modernization**: Many countries are undergoing legal reforms and modernization efforts aimed at improving the efficiency, accessibility, and predictability of their legal systems. As part of these efforts, policymakers may draw on best practices from both civil and common law systems to develop new laws and procedures.
>
> While these trends suggest some convergence between civil law and common law systems, it's important to recognize that significant differences still exist, particularly in areas such as the role of precedent, legal reasoning, and the structure of legal institutions. Moreover, the pace and extent of convergence may vary depending on the specific legal traditions and cultural contexts of different jurisdictions.

*One example is the decision made by the Conseil d'État in 1973 regarding the case of Miss Peynet. Miss Peynet is a woman working for the public administration but not as a public servant. In France, individuals working within the public sector are governed not by the labor code but by a specialized statute designed for public employees. Within this framework, there exist two distinct categories of public employees: permanent public servants and contractual agents. Contractual agents, unlike permanent public servants, are bound by specific employment contracts and do not enjoy the same protections afforded by labor laws. Their employment terms are typically limited, often requiring renewal with each new period of service.*

*Miss Peynet, being a contractual agent, found herself in a challenging situation when she became pregnant. The administration opted not to renew her contract during this time, effectively ending her employment. Both the statutes of permanent servants and the labor code have an article that says that women who are pregnant can’t be fired, but Miss Peynet wasn't protected by either of the two statutes.*

*The judge faced difficulty. If the law is strictly applied, he would have to say sorry to Miss Peynet, declaring that even if she is pregnant, she is not protected by either the labor code or by the statute for permanent public servants, so the administration had the full right to fire her. She didn’t have any protection for being a pregnant worker. So the judge acted in a different way and decided that even if the statutes regarding Miss Peynet do not protect her in an explicit way, there is a general principle in the French legal system that comes from the liberal rights of a citizen in France. This means, in general, that when a woman is pregnant, she can’t be fired.*

*This demonstrates how judges in continental legal systems address emerging issues by invoking general principles, akin to practices in common law systems. By relying on a repository of general principles, judges can tackle novel challenges with a more flexible and adaptable legal framework.*

> Considering that the lady x... was recruited on September 17, 1965 by the territory of Belfort as a practical nurse to carry out her duties at the medico-pedagogical institute "les éparses" in Chaux; that the said functions involved her in the execution of the public service; that thus, she had the status of an agent under public law; that while she was pregnant and had sent the administration a certificate attesting to her state of pregnancy, she was dismissed by a decision of the prefect of the territory of Belfort on August 4, 1967;
>
> Considering that on the date of his dismissal, the only provisions relating to the situation of auxiliary staff in the territory of Belfort related to remuneration and leave and included, in particular, no guarantee of the retention of pregnant women in their jobs;
>
> But considering that the **general principle**, inspired by Article 29 of Book 1 of the Labour Code, according to which no employer may, except in certain cases, dismiss an employee in a state of pregnancy, applies to women employed in public services when, as in this case, no need specific to these services opposes it; that, as a result, the decision of the Prefect of the territory of Belfort, which was taken in ignorance of this principle, is tainted by excess of power; that, therefore, the lady x... is justified in arguing that it is wrongly that, by the judgment attack, the administrative court of Besançon rejected the conclusions of its request against this decision;

*The case of Ms. Trompier-Gravier in 1944 is another example. In France, to conduct trade in a public area, one typically needs approval from the public administration. Ms. Trompier-Gravier had obtained such approval. However, the administration revoked her permission without providing any explanation or opportunity for her to defend herself.*

*The judge encountered a similar dilemma as in the previous example. The issue was the lack of specific protections, such as the right to present oneself and the right to know the reasons for sanctions, in the code governing individuals occupying public space. However, the judge ruled that the general principle of the right to a fair trial should also apply in cases where individuals face penalties imposed by the administration. This principle includes rights such as being informed of one's actions and the right to defend oneself. This approach reflects the flexibility and adaptability seen in common law systems, where general principles of law are applied across various legal domains. As a result, judges in civil and criminal law cases also utilize these general principles in their decisions.*

> Ms. Trompier-Gravier, who was the holder of an authorization to sell newspapers in a kiosk on Boulevard Saint-Denis in Paris, had this authorization withdrawn on the grounds that she would have wanted to extort funds from her manager. The administration had not, before taking this decision, invited the person concerned to explain the facts of which she was accused.
>
> The Council of State annulled the decision to withdraw the authorization by ruling that "given the seriousness of this sanction, such a measure could not legally intervene without the widower Trompier-Gravier being able to discuss the grievances made against her".
>
> In this decision, the Council of State affirms the existence of a general principle of respect for the rights of the defence that must apply to all measures taken by the administration provided that two conditions are met: the measure must take, for the person concerned, the character of a sanction; it must be, for the person concerned, sufficiently serious.
>
> In fact, two essential requirements derive from the principle of respect for the rights of the defence: the person concerned must be informed early enough that a measure will be taken against him and of the facts against him, so as to be able to prepare his defense (EC, 20 January 1956, N...) and, when the texts provide for the communication of his file to the person concerned, it must be complete.
