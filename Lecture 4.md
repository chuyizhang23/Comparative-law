## Characters of the common law system

### Customs in common law

Common law encompasses a set of principles that coexist with statutory laws and involve judges' interpretation and the application of precedents. In many areas, customs govern without the presence of written laws.

For example, **common law marriage** in the US and UK refers to a relationship between two persons living together as married people.

> ==Common law marriage== is a legal concept that recognizes a marriage between two individuals who have not obtained a marriage license or participated in a formal marriage ceremony. Instead, the marriage is considered valid based on the couple's cohabitation and public acknowledgment of their relationship as marital partners. In jurisdictions that recognize common law marriage, certain criteria must typically be met for the relationship to be legally recognized as a marriage, such as mutual consent, cohabitation, and presenting themselves to others as married. The requirements for common law marriage vary by jurisdiction, and not all states or countries recognize it.

Generally, marriage requires a formal wedding done in front of a person, which is an act that is written in law.

> In the United States, the requirement for a formal wedding ceremony to establish a legal marriage varies by state. While most states do require some form of formal solemnization, such as a ceremony conducted by an authorized officiant (such as a religious leader or a judge) in front of witnesses, the specifics of these requirements can differ.
>
> However, some states recognize common law marriage, where a formal wedding ceremony may not be necessary. In states that recognize common law marriage, couples who meet certain criteria, such as living together as spouses and holding themselves out as married, can be considered legally married without a formal ceremony.

In situations where common law marriage is recognized, the two people in common law marriage are considered in the same situation as those who are formally married. They are living together, solidarity together; there is some legal praxis.

> In essence, common law marriage recognizes that two people can be in the same legal situation as a formally married couple, even though they have not completed the formalities typically required by law to establish a marital union. Despite the absence of a formal act, common law marriage recognizes the couple's mutual intent to enter into a marital relationship and treats them as legally married for various purposes, such as property rights, inheritance, and spousal benefits.

Common law marriage is a practice that is approved and done by the court when there is no official wedding involved. It is due to the fact that in the US during the 1980s, many people lived in territories where there were no judges. These people lived together, having children, but didn't legally justify their wedding or marriage.

The underlying principle of the recognition of common law marriage is the recognition of the consensus, that the two people treat their relationship as married people instead of just two people living together.

> In jurisdictions that recognize common law marriage, couples are typically required to demonstrate their mutual intent to enter into a marital relationship and hold themselves out to others as married. This mutual consent is a key element in establishing common law marriage and reflects the principle that individuals should have the freedom to form marital relationships based on their mutual agreement, even without a formal ceremony or legal documentation. Therefore, the recognition of common law marriage can be seen as a recognition of the general consensus between the parties to establish a marital relationship.
>
> In other words, it implies that the attitudes, behaviors, and expectations commonly observed in married couples—such as mutual support, shared responsibilities, and commitment—should also be present in relationships where partners cohabit without being legally married. This perspective acknowledges that the nature of the relationship, characterized by cohabitation and mutual commitment, is more significant than the formal legal status of marriage.

With common law, consensus emerges from various legal sources, such as judicial rulings that build upon precedent. Over time, these decisions contribute to the development of an unwritten body of law.

> Consensus, in the sense of widespread agreement or acceptance among legal practitioners, scholars, and judges, is not typically considered a formal source of law in the common law system. In common law jurisdictions, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, formal sources of law primarily include statutes, case law (precedent), and legal customs. However, consensus among legal professionals and scholars may influence judicial interpretation and application of the law.

### Adaptability of common law

In common law, nothing is definitive or set in stone, as courts always have the ability to revisit and reconsider precedent.

The rule of precedent means that judges are responsible for applying the law to each case. They do this by examining legal texts, court judgments, and cases similar to the one at hand. For instance, they might look at how divorce is defined or handled when children are involved. Based on these elements, judges issue judgments, considering both statutory law and common law principles.

The common law system is highly adaptable, allowing judges to determine how to apply typical solutions for specific cases, even in the presence of precedents. Judges can either apply traditional decisions from the supreme court or high court, or opt to disregard these precedents and choose alternative solutions.

In the common law system, judges in lower courts have the flexibility to interpret customs and apply written laws in new ways when necessary to justify their decisions. They are not obligated to follow the rulings of higher courts. If parties disagree with a lower court's decision, they can appeal to a higher court to determine whether the original decision stands or if a new solution should be offered.

### Comparison to the civil law system

The common law appears to be more adaptable than continental law, which relies heavily on codes. In continental law, the idea here is to say the judge is not the maker of the law but the servant of the law. When there is a text and the whole legal system is made of codes or written text, the judge has to apply these. The adaptability of the legal system arises from the interpretation of these texts, as they can be applied to various solutions. Judges can make interpretations of the law, but not mutations of the law; they cannot give interpretations that denaturalize the law.

#### Government of judges

There is a risk that the judges are not just servants of the law but are also trying to make policies. This happens mainly in France and generally in Europe. There was an evolution in the conception of the work that the judge has about his mission.

The classical principle of the mission of judges since the French Revolution is being the servant of law, applying the law, but not misinterpreting it. From 25 to 35 years ago, some judges in continental law countries were interpreting a law as you do in the common law system. They proposed the liberation of law and judges, with large interpretations. It's a trend coming from the common law.

These judges base their judgments on statutory law and different kinds of general principles.

> In Europe, particularly in countries following the continental legal tradition like France, discussions and debates surrounding the liberation of judicial interpretation of law have been significant. One notable period for such discussions occurred during the late 20^th^ and early 21^st^ centuries, coinciding with broader debates about legal reform, the role of judges, and the balance of power between branches of government. These discussions often revolved around topics such as judicial activism, legal positivism, and the extent to which judges should have discretion in interpreting and applying laws. While there have been calls for greater judicial independence and flexibility in legal interpretation, the specifics of any movement or initiative would depend on the political and legal context of the time.

#### The situation in France

In the continental legal system, law is written law. But about 100 years ago, between the two world wars, there was a movement in the administration area of the law. The administrative judges decided to make an interpretation of rights, not only with statute law but also with references to what they call the general principle of law. The judges pick the general principles of law in terms of what they call the liberal tradition of French law.

General principles in law are not codified statutes but rather traditions and customs that judges rely on. In common law, these traditions are complemented by statutory law, creating a distinct legal framework. However, in recent years, there has been a blurring of the lines between common law and continental law practices.

Judges in continental law systems are increasingly adopting interpretations similar to those found in common law. This shift can be attributed to the need to address new societal challenges that arise after the world wars. Statutory laws often prove inadequate in addressing these novel issues, prompting judges to turn to broader interpretations and general principles. This adaptation reflects the changing landscape of legal systems as they strive to respond to evolving societal needs.

While civil law and common law systems have traditionally been distinct in their approaches to legal principles and procedures, there has been a trend toward convergence or borrowing of practices between the two systems in recent years. This can be attributed to various factors such as globalization, increased international trade, and the cross-fertilization of legal ideas through academic exchange and comparative legal studies. However, it's important to note that despite some convergence, significant differences between civil law and common law systems still exist.

> Here are some ways in which the differences between civil law and common law systems may be diminishing:
>
> 1. **Codification and Case Law**: Civil law systems are traditionally based on codified laws, while common law systems rely heavily on case law and precedent. However, some civil law jurisdictions have started to recognize the value of precedent and have incorporated elements of case law into their legal systems. Similarly, common law jurisdictions have increasingly relied on statutory codes and codification in certain areas of law.
>
> 2. **Judicial Decision-Making**: In both civil and common law systems, there has been a movement toward more rational and consistent judicial decision-making. Judges in civil law systems may consider principles of fairness and equity, while judges in common law systems may rely on statutes and legal principles more explicitly. However, judges in both systems are increasingly influenced by legal reasoning from other jurisdictions and may draw on a broader range of sources when making decisions.
>
> 3. **Legal Education and Training**: Legal education and training programs are increasingly incorporating comparative law studies, exposing students to different legal traditions and approaches. This can lead to a greater understanding and appreciation of the similarities and differences between civil law and common law systems among legal professionals.
>
> 4. **Internationalization of Law**: With the growth of international trade and investment, there has been an increased need for harmonization of legal standards and practices across different jurisdictions. International organizations and agreements often facilitate this process by promoting common legal principles and standards that transcend traditional distinctions between civil law and common law systems.
>
> 5. **Legal Reform and Modernization**: Many countries are undergoing legal reforms and modernization efforts aimed at improving the efficiency, accessibility, and predictability of their legal systems. As part of these efforts, policymakers may draw on best practices from both civil and common law systems to develop new laws and procedures.
>
> While these trends suggest some convergence between civil law and common law systems, it's important to recognize that significant differences still exist, particularly in areas such as the role of precedent, legal reasoning, and the structure of legal institutions. Moreover, the pace and extent of convergence may vary depending on the specific legal traditions and cultural contexts of different jurisdictions.

*One example is the decision made by the Conseil d'État in 1973 regarding the case of Miss Peynet. Miss Peynet is a woman working for the public administration but not as a public servant. In France, individuals working within the public sector are governed not by the labor code but by a specialized statute designed for public employees. Within this framework, there exist two distinct categories of public employees: permanent public servants and contractual agents. Contractual agents, unlike permanent public servants, are bound by specific employment contracts and do not enjoy the same protections afforded by labor laws. Their employment terms are typically limited, often requiring renewal with each new period of service.*

*Miss Peynet, being a contractual agent, found herself in a challenging situation when she became pregnant. The administration opted not to renew her contract during this time, effectively ending her employment. Both the statutes of permanent servants and the labor code have an article that says that women who are pregnant can’t be fired, but Miss Peynet wasn't protected by either of the two statutes.*

*The judge faced difficulty. If the law is strictly applied, he would have to say sorry to Miss Peynet, declaring that even if she is pregnant, she is not protected by either the labor code or by the statute for permanent public servants, so the administration had the full right to fire her. She didn’t have any protection for being a pregnant worker. So the judge acted in a different way and decided that even if the statutes regarding Miss Peynet do not protect her in an explicit way, there is a general principle in the French legal system that comes from the liberal rights of a citizen in France. This means, in general, that when a woman is pregnant, she can’t be fired.*

*This demonstrates how judges in continental legal systems address emerging issues by invoking general principles, akin to practices in common law systems. By relying on a repository of general principles, judges can tackle novel challenges with a more flexible and adaptable legal framework.*

> Considering that the lady x... was recruited on September 17, 1965 by the territory of Belfort as a practical nurse to carry out her duties at the medico-pedagogical institute "les éparses" in Chaux; that the said functions involved her in the execution of the public service; that thus, she had the status of an agent under public law; that while she was pregnant and had sent the administration a certificate attesting to her state of pregnancy, she was dismissed by a decision of the prefect of the territory of Belfort on August 4, 1967;
>
> Considering that on the date of his dismissal, the only provisions relating to the situation of auxiliary staff in the territory of Belfort related to remuneration and leave and included, in particular, no guarantee of the retention of pregnant women in their jobs;
>
> But considering that the **general principle**, inspired by Article 29 of Book 1 of the Labour Code, according to which no employer may, except in certain cases, dismiss an employee in a state of pregnancy, applies to women employed in public services when, as in this case, no need specific to these services opposes it; that, as a result, the decision of the Prefect of the territory of Belfort, which was taken in ignorance of this principle, is tainted by excess of power; that, therefore, the lady x... is justified in arguing that it is wrongly that, by the judgment attack, the administrative court of Besançon rejected the conclusions of its request against this decision;

*The case of Ms. Trompier-Gravier in 1944 is another example. In France, to conduct trade in a public area, one typically needs approval from the public administration. Ms. Trompier-Gravier had obtained such approval. However, the administration revoked her permission without providing any explanation or opportunity for her to defend herself.*

*The judge encountered a similar dilemma as in the previous example. The issue was the lack of specific protections, such as the right to present oneself and the right to know the reasons for sanctions, in the code governing individuals occupying public space. However, the judge ruled that the general principle of the right to a fair trial should also apply in cases where individuals face penalties imposed by the administration. This principle includes rights such as being informed of one's actions and the right to defend oneself. This approach reflects the flexibility and adaptability seen in common law systems, where general principles of law are applied across various legal domains. As a result, judges in civil and criminal law cases also utilize these general principles in their decisions.*

> Ms. Trompier-Gravier, who was the holder of an authorization to sell newspapers in a kiosk on Boulevard Saint-Denis in Paris, had this authorization withdrawn on the grounds that she would have wanted to extort funds from her manager. The administration had not, before taking this decision, invited the person concerned to explain the facts of which she was accused.
>
> The Council of State annulled the decision to withdraw the authorization by ruling that "given the seriousness of this sanction, such a measure could not legally intervene without the widower Trompier-Gravier being able to discuss the grievances made against her".
>
> In this decision, the Council of State affirms the existence of a general principle of respect for the rights of the defence that must apply to all measures taken by the administration provided that two conditions are met: the measure must take, for the person concerned, the character of a sanction; it must be, for the person concerned, sufficiently serious.
>
> In fact, two essential requirements derive from the principle of respect for the rights of the defence: the person concerned must be informed early enough that a measure will be taken against him and of the facts against him, so as to be able to prepare his defense (EC, 20 January 1956, N...) and, when the texts provide for the communication of his file to the person concerned, it must be complete.

## Introduction to the Islamic legal system

Islamic law, also called **Sharia**, is a law that is applied by Muslim people to Muslim people.

> ==Sharia==, often referred to as Islamic law, is the religious legal system derived from the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. It governs various aspects of Muslim life, including personal morality, religious observances, family law, criminal law, and commercial transactions. Sharia is considered by Muslims to be the divine law prescribed by God for human conduct and is interpreted by Islamic scholars and jurists to address contemporary issues while remaining rooted in the foundational texts of Islam. However, interpretations of Sharia can vary among different Muslim communities and scholars, leading to diverse legal practices in different regions of the Muslim world.

In reality, there are many legal principles in the Islamic legal system, but what is important to keep in mind is that there is no global or similar application of Islamic law. These principles, coming from the Islamic legal system, are some legal elements that are different in every Muslim country.

In various Muslim countries, Islamic law is applied to different degrees. Some nations implement Islamic law partially, meaning it applies to certain activities, while others adopt it more extensively. For instance, Iran fully applies Islamic law, whereas Tunisia and Morocco blend Sharia principles with statutory laws enacted by their parliaments.

Some Muslim countries were colonized and underwent significant changes during that period. Following independence, many of these nations retained certain aspects of the legal systems imposed by their colonial rulers. For instance, Pakistan, once under British rule, adopted elements of the common law system introduced by the British authorities. Similarly, countries like Algeria, which was under French rule, incorporated French legal concepts, evident in the use of Arabic terms corresponding to "Département" and "Préfet" in French, with family and trade law governed by Islamic tenets. Meanwhile, countries like Tunisia and Morocco have family laws grounded in Islamic principles, blending them with local statutory laws influenced by common law or continental law systems during colonization.

In the Islamic legal system, there exist written texts alongside various interpretations of the law. These interpretations are made by different authorities, including judges, governments, and religious authorities. Even when referring to the same text, variations in interpretation arise among these authorities. As a result, different solutions are often proposed for the same question, and conflicting solutions can be observed. From this perspective, the Islamic legal system shares some similarities with common law.

## The definition of Islamic law

### Two main elements of Islamic law

Islamic law is based on the text of the holy book, the **Quran**, which contains approximately 6,200 verses, of which around 600 have legal significance. These verses were revealed by Prophet Muhammad. The Quran serves as both a legal code and a religious text, containing stories about the relationship between individuals and God, as well as guidance on behavior for followers throughout their lives. It intertwines religious and legal aspects, addressing both spiritual and practical matters.

> The Quran, the holy book of Islam, is divided into chapters, known as surahs, and verses, known as ayahs. The arrangement of the Quran is as follows:
>
> 1. **Surahs**: The Quran consists of 114 surahs of varying lengths. These surahs are not arranged chronologically; instead, they are organized based on their length, with the longest surahs typically found at the beginning and the shorter ones toward the end.
>
> 2. **Meccan and Medinan Surahs**: Another important aspect of the arrangement of the Quran is the distinction between Meccan and Medinan surahs. The surahs revealed in Mecca, during the early period of Prophet Muhammad's prophethood, tend to focus on spiritual and theological themes, while the Medinan surahs, revealed in Medina after the migration of the Prophet, often deal with legal and social matters. The arrangement alternates between Meccan and Medinan surahs, with some exceptions.
>
> 3. **Themes and Topics**: The Quran covers a wide range of topics, including monotheism, prophethood, morality, guidance for personal conduct, social justice, legal matters, and eschatology (the study of the end times). These themes are interwoven throughout the surahs, often complementing and reinforcing one another.
>
> 4. **Verses (Ayahs)**: Each surah is further divided into verses, or ayahs, which vary in length. The number of verses in each surah can range from a few to several hundred. These verses serve as the fundamental units of the Quranic text and are often cited individually for study, recitation, and reflection.
>
> 5. **Opening Chapter (Al-Fatiha)**: The Quran begins with the opening chapter, Al-Fatiha, which is considered the essence of the entire Quran. It is recited in every unit of the Muslim prayer (Salah) and holds special significance in Islamic worship and spirituality.
>
> Overall, the arrangement of the Quran reflects a divine order believed by Muslims to have been revealed to Prophet Muhammad over a period of approximately 23 years. It is considered by Muslims to be the literal word of God (Allah) and the ultimate guide for humanity's spiritual, moral, and ethical guidance.

*The Quran is not the only religious holy book containing legal aspects; the Bible also shares this characteristic. Within the Bible, there are verses that prescribe obligations for believers to follow. A journalist authored a book titled “Follow the Rules of the Bible for One Year,” in which he attempted to adhere to the obligations outlined in the Bible. However, he found it impossible to comply with all of them due to conflicts and their incompatibility with modern life.*

**Fiqh** is the interpretation of the legal verses of the Quran by interpreters like religious scholars or religious authorities.

> ==Fiqh== is the Islamic jurisprudence, which refers to the understanding and interpretation of Islamic law derived from the Quran, Hadith (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad), Ijma (consensus of scholars), and Qiyas (analogy). It encompasses the practical application of Islamic principles to various aspects of life, including worship, transactions, family law, ethics, and social issues. Fiqh provides guidelines for Muslims on how to conduct themselves in accordance with Islamic teachings and principles. It is studied and interpreted by Islamic scholars to address contemporary issues and adapt to changing circumstances while remaining rooted in Islamic tradition.

The concept here is that the Quran was sent directly to Muhammad, as the chosen one. The Quran is seen as the divine law since it is considered to be the direct expression of what God wants Muslims to behave like. Fiqh, on the other hand, is the human law since it is not given by God but is the result of interpretations made by humans. There is a co-existence of divine law and human law.

### Different catagories of Islamic law

- **Ibadah (Worship)**: This category deals with rituals and acts of worship prescribed in Islam, such as prayer (Salah), fasting (Sawm), charity (Zakat), pilgrimage (Hajj), and other religious duties. It includes rules and guidelines for performing these acts of worship according to Islamic teachings.

- **Mu'amalat (Transactions and Contracts)**: Mu'amalat governs transactions, contracts, and commercial dealings in Islamic law. It includes rules related to buying, selling, lending, borrowing, leasing, partnership, and other financial transactions. Islamic finance, which operates based on Sharia principles, falls under this category.

- **Family Law (Ahwal al-Shakhsiyah)**: Family law deals with matters related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, guardianship, and child custody. It includes rules and procedures for conducting marriage contracts, resolving marital disputes, dividing inheritance, and determining familial rights and obligations.

- **Criminal Law (Jinayat)**: Criminal law encompasses rules and penalties for offenses considered crimes in Islam. These offenses may include theft, adultery, false accusation (Qadhf), apostasy (Riddah), and certain acts of violence. Punishments prescribed by Sharia for these crimes vary, including fines, imprisonment, corporal punishment, or in severe cases, capital punishment.

- **Public Law (Siyasah Shar'iyyah)**: Public law governs matters related to governance, administration, and public policy in an Islamic state. It includes principles of Islamic governance, the role of the state in enforcing Sharia, the duties and responsibilities of rulers and officials, and the administration of justice.

- **Personal Status Law (Ahwal al-Shakhsiyah)**: Personal status law addresses individual legal status and rights, including matters such as citizenship, residency, and legal capacity. It also includes rules related to personal conduct and behavior, such as ethics, manners, and obligations towards others.

- **Ethical and Moral Guidance**: Islamic law provides guidance on ethical and moral conduct, emphasizing virtues such as honesty, justice, kindness, compassion, and integrity. These principles are foundational to Islamic teachings and are intended to guide Muslims in their interactions with others and their behavior in society.

### Globalization

With globalization, significant developments in international law have occurred over the past half-century. Local legal systems are increasingly influenced by globalization and the activities of various international organizations. This influence extends to Islamic legal systems as well. Some challenges faced by Muslim law cannot be addressed solely through classical Islamic legal principles but require reference to international law. For instance, in societies with diverse nationalities, resolving issues may necessitate the application of international laws, even within Muslim-majority countries. In international trade, Islamic law may be influenced by regulations from international bodies such as the WTO. Thus, even when applying Islamic law, it must be interpreted in alignment with international legal norms.

There are significant concerns regarding human rights. For example, there is a global protection agreement from the UN from 1949 that has been recognized by many countries. At the same time, some Muslim countries have recognized the Islamic Declaration of Human Rights, which is a mix of some international declarations protecting human rights and, simultaneously, the integration of several interpretations of Islamic Personal Status Law, such as the right of personality.

> The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam is a declaration adopted in 1990 by member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which is an international organization consisting of 57 member states with predominantly Muslim populations. The declaration was drafted as a response to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. While the Universal Declaration is a secular document reflecting Western liberal values, the Cairo Declaration seeks to articulate human rights principles from an Islamic perspective.
>
> Key points about the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam:
>
> 1. **Islamic Perspective**: The declaration emphasizes that human rights are rooted in Islamic Sharia law and principles. It aims to protect human dignity, freedom, and justice within the framework of Islamic teachings.
>
> 2. **Equal Rights and Non-Discrimination**: The Cairo Declaration affirms the equality of all human beings regardless of race, color, language, sex, religion, political affiliation, social status, or other factors. It prohibits discrimination and emphasizes the right to equal treatment before the law.
>
> 3. **Freedom and Justice**: The declaration recognizes the right to freedom of expression, belief, and association, as long as they do not contradict Sharia law. It also emphasizes the right to due process and fair trial, as well as the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
>
> 4. **Individual Rights and Responsibilities**: The Cairo Declaration emphasizes the importance of individual rights and freedoms, while also stressing the responsibility of individuals to uphold moral and social values prescribed by Islam.
>
> 5. **Compatibility with Sharia**: While affirming certain universal human rights principles, the Cairo Declaration states that human rights in Islam are subject to Sharia law and may be limited or modified based on Islamic legal principles.
>
> Criticism of the Cairo Declaration:
>
> 1. **Limitations on Rights**: Critics argue that the declaration falls short of international human rights standards, as it allows for limitations on rights based on Sharia law, which may result in restrictions on freedom of expression, religion, and other fundamental freedoms.
>
> 2. **Gender Equality**: The declaration has been criticized for its treatment of women's rights, as it does not explicitly guarantee equality between men and women and allows for certain provisions that are seen as discriminatory against women under Sharia law.
>
> 3. **Lack of Enforcement Mechanisms**: Like many declarations, the Cairo Declaration lacks enforcement mechanisms, which means that member states are not legally bound to adhere to its principles.
>
> Overall, the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam represents an attempt by member states of the OIC to articulate human rights principles within an Islamic framework. However, its compatibility with international human rights standards and its implementation in practice continue to be subjects of debate and criticism.

### Jurisdictional

There is integration in Western countries, primarily concerning the scope of the application of Islamic laws. In these countries, where Muslim communities exist, the question arises as to whether religious laws can be applied to a community of Muslim people who are not the majority.

In France, including the island of Mayotte, Islamic law does not have any legal authority, even in areas where there is a majority of Muslim inhabitants. Instead, French civil law applies uniformly to all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs. This principle of legal unity means that the same laws govern everyone, and there is no special consideration given to any particular religion. In public life, citizens of all religious backgrounds are subject to the same laws and regulations, and there is no provision for the prioritization of religious rules. While Muslim believers are free to practice their religion in their personal lives, such as following dietary restrictions, these practices must adhere to the overarching legal framework established by French civil law.

In Canada, particularly in Ontario, individuals have the option to request the application of Sharia law for certain matters. For example, Muslim individuals may seek to have their family law cases heard by Muslim judges. Similarly, in Great Britain, Sharia law is applicable in specific areas such as family law and divorce, as well as some contract laws. While the application of Sharia law is not extensive in these countries, there are provisions for addressing individual concerns and questions within the legal framework.

> In both Canada and the United Kingdom, there are religious arbitration tribunals, including those operating under Islamic law principles, known as Sharia councils or tribunals. These councils primarily handle family law matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance, based on Islamic legal principles. However, it's essential to note that decisions made by these tribunals are not legally binding unless both parties agree to abide by them. Additionally, these decisions must comply with the laws of the country and cannot override the rights guaranteed by the national legal system. If a decision made by a Sharia tribunal is challenged or found to contravene national law, it can be appealed or reviewed by the national courts.

#### Laïcité in France

In France, they are staunch advocates of secularism, known as laïcité. The principle dictates that the state remains neutral and independent, standing apart from all religions. There is no official religion or church recognized by the state. For citizens, religion is considered a matter of private life, not public life. Laïcité does not aim to oppose religions; rather, it prohibits the state from establishing relations with religions and religious institutions. Individuals are not permitted to request that the administration accommodate their religious beliefs.

For example, in France, holidays primarily reflect Christian traditions due to the historical majority of Christians in the country. Therefore, religious holidays of other faiths are not officially recognized, and these days are treated as regular working days. However, individuals do have the right to request time off for religious observance, which is considered within the context of standard vacation or personal leave allowances.

If you choose to wear a hijab, you are permitted to do so in the private sector, except in situations where there may be safety risks, such as working in a kitchen where there is a potential fire hazard. However, wearing a hijab while working in the public sector is not permitted, as public servants are expected to adhere to the principle of religious neutrality outlined in French law. According to French statutes, individuals representing the state should remain neutral in matters of religion. Therefore, employees in the public sector are prohibited from displaying any religious symbols while on duty.

> In France, the law regarding the wearing of hijabs, or headscarves worn by Muslim women, is governed primarily by the principle of laïcité, or secularism. Laïcité is enshrined in the French Constitution and aims to ensure the separation of religion and state in public institutions.
>
> There have been several laws and regulations enacted in France that restrict the wearing of religious symbols, including hijabs, in certain public settings:
>
> 1. **2004 Law on Secularism and Conspicuous Religious Symbols in Schools**: This law prohibits the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols, including hijabs, in public primary and secondary schools. It applies to both students and staff members.
>
> 2. **2010 Law Banning Face Coverings in Public Spaces**: Commonly known as the "burqa ban," this law prohibits the wearing of face-covering veils, including the niqab and burqa, in public spaces. While the law does not specifically mention hijabs, it effectively restricts the wearing of full-face veils in public areas.
>
> 3. **2016 Administrative Court Ruling on Burkini Bans**: In 2016, several municipalities in France implemented bans on burkinis, full-body swimsuits worn by some Muslim women. However, these bans were challenged in administrative courts, with some courts ruling that they violated fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of religion.
>
> Overall, while there is no specific law in France banning the wearing of hijabs in public spaces, the principle of laïcité and certain laws and regulations restrict the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols in certain contexts, particularly in public schools and government institutions. However, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws have been subject to debate and legal challenges, reflecting broader discussions about religious freedom, cultural diversity, and secularism in French society.

*Mayotte, an island in the Indian Ocean close to Madagascar, is an exception to this principle due to its significant Muslim community, which comprises the majority of the population. As a result, certain aspects of Islamic law are applied, such as the choice to marry either in front of a secular judge or before a qadi, a specialized Islamic judge.*

> Mayotte, as an overseas department and region of France, is subject to French law, including the principle of laïcité, or secularism. Therefore, laïcité is applicable in Mayotte, just as it is in mainland France.
>
> Laïcité in Mayotte means that the state remains neutral and independent from religious affairs. There is no official religion or church recognized by the state, and religious practices are considered a matter of private life, not public life. Like in mainland France, there may be regulations regarding the wearing of religious symbols in certain public institutions, such as schools.
>
> While Mayotte has a predominantly Muslim population, reflecting its cultural and historical ties to the Comoros archipelago, the principle of laïcité still applies in governmental and public settings. This means that public institutions in Mayotte operate without religious affiliation, and individuals are expected to separate their religious beliefs from their roles as citizens in public life.

In France, the issue of coexistence presents challenges, particularly concerning dietary practices. While individuals have the right to adhere to the dietary rules of their religion, they cannot compel public institutions to accommodate specific religious dietary requirements. For instance, in schools, students are not required to consume foods that conflict with their religious beliefs, such as pork for Muslims. However, they do not have the right to request substitutes or demand that meals be served in accordance with halal or other religious guidelines.
