## Characters of the common law system

### Customs in common law

Common law encompasses a set of principles that coexist with statutory laws and involve judges' interpretation and the application of precedents. In many areas, customs govern without the presence of written laws.

For example, **common law marriage** in the US and UK refers to a relationship between two persons living together as married people.

> ==Common law marriage== is a legal concept that recognizes a marriage between two individuals who have not obtained a marriage license or participated in a formal marriage ceremony. Instead, the marriage is considered valid based on the couple's cohabitation and public acknowledgment of their relationship as marital partners. In jurisdictions that recognize common law marriage, certain criteria must typically be met for the relationship to be legally recognized as a marriage, such as mutual consent, cohabitation, and presenting themselves to others as married. The requirements for common law marriage vary by jurisdiction, and not all states or countries recognize it.

Generally, marriage requires a formal wedding done in front of a person, which is an act that is written in law.

> In the United States, the requirement for a formal wedding ceremony to establish a legal marriage varies by state. While most states do require some form of formal solemnization, such as a ceremony conducted by an authorized officiant (such as a religious leader or a judge) in front of witnesses, the specifics of these requirements can differ.
>
> However, some states recognize common law marriage, where a formal wedding ceremony may not be necessary. In states that recognize common law marriage, couples who meet certain criteria, such as living together as spouses and holding themselves out as married, can be considered legally married without a formal ceremony.

In situations where common law marriage is recognized, the two people in common law marriage are considered in the same situation as those who are formally married. They are living together, solidarity together; there is some legal praxis.

> In essence, common law marriage recognizes that two people can be in the same legal situation as a formally married couple, even though they have not completed the formalities typically required by law to establish a marital union. Despite the absence of a formal act, common law marriage recognizes the couple's mutual intent to enter into a marital relationship and treats them as legally married for various purposes, such as property rights, inheritance, and spousal benefits.

Common law marriage is a practice that is approved and done by the court when there is no official wedding involved. It is due to the fact that in the US during the 1980s, many people lived in territories where there were no judges. These people lived together, having children, but didn't legally justify their wedding or marriage.

The underlying principle of the recognition of common law marriage is the recognition of the consensus, that the two people treat their relationship as married people instead of just two people living together.

> In jurisdictions that recognize common law marriage, couples are typically required to demonstrate their mutual intent to enter into a marital relationship and hold themselves out to others as married. This mutual consent is a key element in establishing common law marriage and reflects the principle that individuals should have the freedom to form marital relationships based on their mutual agreement, even without a formal ceremony or legal documentation. Therefore, the recognition of common law marriage can be seen as a recognition of the general consensus between the parties to establish a marital relationship.
>
> In other words, it implies that the attitudes, behaviors, and expectations commonly observed in married couples—such as mutual support, shared responsibilities, and commitment—should also be present in relationships where partners cohabit without being legally married. This perspective acknowledges that the nature of the relationship, characterized by cohabitation and mutual commitment, is more significant than the formal legal status of marriage.
