## Continental law system

### The continental and civil law legal systems

The **Continental and Civil Law Legal Systems** can be truly considered to be the most prominent legal systems in the world which laid a foundation for legislation in many countries. Although, nowadays it can be quite difficult to find a distinguished boundary between Continental and Common Law Legal Systems (as they have adopted each other’s practices to a large extent), the legal scholars point out the list of criteria which might be employed to differentiate between those two legal systems. For instance, some scholars proposed “culture” or “language” to be used for classification. Others insisted that it must be ideology which stipulates peculiarities of Continental and Common Law Legal Systems. However, most of the scholars do agree that historical background and types of the sources used are the most objective criteria.

The Continental Law Legal System takes its origin in Roman Law in times when it was first codified by Roman emperor Justinian. Justinian’s efforts resulted in compilation called Corpus Juris Civilis. The fact that Corpus Juris Civilis was a main object for study in the Italian universities of Renaissance period enabled the Roman Law to spread over the rest of Europe and greatly influence European legal systems. The result of such influence was a continued tradition of codification during the age of enlightenment (in XVIII century) when separate national codes such as The French Napoleonic Code, German and Swiss codes were developed.

The Continental Law Legal System has been formed under the influence of legal scholars whose legal doctrines became a basis for codes. *Therefore, it is commonly accepted that civil law was developed in the universities rather than in courts.* In other words, the written rules such as legislative statutes have been the main source of law in civil law countries. It is precisely this fact that explains a diminished judge’s role in Continental Law Legal System. Since a civil judge has to apply already existing codes for resolving cases instead of expressing his judicial opinions there is much less importance attached to a civil judge’s merit in contrast to his common counterpart.

Common or English Legal System was first developed in England and Wales. It was later adopted by many countries throughout the world as a result of British colonisation. Australia, South East Asia, India and Hong Kong are the countries with “received” common tradition. The Common Law Legal System has been developed out of unwritten rules and customs. In common countries the cases are resolved by “judge-made decisions” which follow the principle of stare decisis, i.e. “to decide similar cases similarly”. This fact explains the importance of case law as a primary source of English Legal System.

> The principle of **stare decisis** is a fundamental doctrine in common law legal systems that obligates courts to follow the precedents set by previous judicial decisions when the same points arise again in litigation. The term "stare decisis" is Latin for "to stand by things decided." This principle ensures legal consistency, predictability, and stability by maintaining that similar cases are decided in similar ways.
>
> **Key Components of Stare Decisis:**
>
> 1. **Adherence to Precedent:**
>    - Courts are expected to follow the legal principles established in prior decisions, especially those from higher courts within the same jurisdiction.
>    - This adherence applies primarily to the *ratio decidendi*, the legal reasoning or principle upon which a case's decision is based.
>
> 2. **Hierarchy of Courts:**
>    - Lower courts are bound by the decisions of higher appellate courts.
>    - Decisions from courts of equal standing or from other jurisdictions may be considered persuasive but are not binding.
>
> 3. **Binding vs. Persuasive Precedent:**
>    - **Binding Precedent:** Must be followed. It comes from higher courts in the same jurisdiction.
>    - **Persuasive Precedent:** May influence a decision but is not obligatory. It can come from lower courts, courts of equal status, or courts in other jurisdictions.
>
> 4. **Exceptions and Overruling:**
>    - A court may depart from precedent if it deems the previous decision was wrong or societal conditions have changed.
>    - Higher courts have the authority to overrule decisions from lower courts or their own past decisions.
>
> **Advantages of Stare Decisis:**
>
> - **Legal Certainty:** Individuals and businesses can predict legal outcomes, which aids in planning and risk assessment.
> - **Equality and Fairness:** Similar cases are treated alike, promoting a sense of justice and impartiality.
> - **Efficiency:** Courts save time by relying on established legal principles rather than re-evaluating settled law in every case.
>
> **Limitations of Stare Decisis:**
>
> - **Rigidity:** Strict adherence may perpetuate outdated or unjust rulings.
> - **Judicial Discretion:** Judges may interpret precedents differently, leading to inconsistent applications.
> - **Evolving Societal Values:** Law may lag behind societal changes if courts are reluctant to overturn precedents.
>
> **Examples:**
>
> - **Brown v. Board of Education (1954, U.S.):** The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), showing that stare decisis allows for correction of past errors.
> - **Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932, UK):** Established the modern concept of negligence, setting a precedent for duty of care that courts have followed in subsequent cases.
>
> **Application in Legal Systems:**
>
> - **Common Law Jurisdictions:** Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia heavily rely on stare decisis.
> - **Civil Law Jurisdictions:** Less emphasis on precedent; courts focus more on statutory codes and less on judicial decisions.
>
> **Conclusion:**
>
> Stare decisis plays a crucial role in maintaining a coherent and stable legal system by ensuring that courts follow established legal principles. While it promotes consistency and reliability, the doctrine is flexible enough to allow the law to adapt over time through judicial review and the overruling of outdated precedents.

#### Procedural and substantive law

Procedural and Substantive Law are two branches of law which can not function independently from each other.

Substantive Law can be described as a body of rules which sets out the rights and obligations of members of society. On the other hand, Procedural Law encompasses legal rules to enforce and defend such rights and obligations. For instance, it is a substantive law that defines murder as a criminal offence. Meanwhile, the Procedural Law describes the way the arrests have to be made, witnesses are questioned and evidences are collected.

### Civil Law and Civil Procedure versus Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure

Civil Law is a form of private law and involves the relationships between individual citizens The Civil law attempts to resolve disagreements between individuals or organizations and to provide remedies. It should be emphasized that unlike criminal law, the civil law does not intend to punish the offender. Contract disputes, property disputes, divorce cases, child custody and other private matters are the issues regulated by Civil Law.

Criminal law is a branch of law which concerns crimes committed against the public authority. In contrast to Civil law where the remedy typically takes the form of compensation or fine, the offender in criminal proceeding can be punished by imprisonment, government supervision, loss of liberty, fine and even execution.

The civil and criminal procedures are different in terms of claimants bringing the case into court and parties involved in the trial process. Civil proceeding is initiated by the plaintiff represented either by an individual or an organization which strives to obtain a financial compensation for incurred damages. By contrast, any criminal proceeding is enforced by the state through the prosecutor. This happens because any crime against an individual is considered to be an offence to the society.

The prosecutor prepares evidences and charges against the accused criminal. Therefore, the burden of proof lies solely upon the prosecutor, which means that the prosecutor is responsible for providing evidences against the defendant. On the other side, the plaintiff is the only person to have the burden of proof in civil cases. Whereas *it is enough for plaintiff in civil procedure to persuade that the wrongdoing was likely to take place rather than not*, the prosecutor has an obligation to prove that the crime was committed *without any doubts*. In other words, the standard of proof in civil and criminal procedures is different: civil cases must be proven on the balance of probabilities and criminal cases – beyond a reasonable doubt.

In fact, the offence might be criminal and civil violation at the same time. For example, in case of car accident when there is an injured person, the driver is subject to criminal as well as civil procedure.

### Civil procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems

The significant differences in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems are stipulated mainly by the adherence either to the so-called “inquisitorial” or “adversarial” systems. Despite the fact that there have been a lot of borrowings recently in both systems, “inquisitorial” tradition is broadly defined as a prerogative of Continental Law trials, whereas Common Law trials follow “adversarial” system.

One of the factors which explain the substantial differences in civil procedures of Common and Continental Legal Systems is a judge’s role. In civil procedure governed by continental tradition the judge examines the evidences, questions the witnesses and prepares report, i.e. controls all aspects of the trial. Meanwhile, the role of judge in common civil procedure is that of a passive observer listening to the arguments and evidences presented both by a plaintiff and a defendant. Therefore, a Continental Law judge bears more responsibility for the trial rather than his Common Law counterpart.

Another point of divergence in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems is the stages of jurisdiction. In continental civil procedure these stages can be defined as preliminary stage, evidence-taking stage and decision making stage. As it can be noticed, the continental civil procedure never includes the trial stage which is sometimes a part of civil procedure in Common Legal System. This can be explained by the fact that in Common Legal System the trial is believed to be a final stage which necessarily includes a jury. Therefore, under such definition the trial does not exist in continental civil procedure. Instead of the trial the continental civil procedure consists of “a series of isolated meetings and written communications between counsel and the judge.”

The next important difference concerns an evidence-taking stage. As a matter of fact, the common lawyer is obliged to formulate the whole case at the very beginning which is an unusual practice for civil lawyers who prepares only some pieces of evidence for the first appearance before the court. Consequently, the degree of importance assigned to discovery process is much less in continental civil procedure rather than in common.

Although in continental civil procedure the judge is directly involved in the evidence-taking part of the proceeding, the case should be resolved by other judges. In contrast, the examination of evidences and the resolution of civil case are direct obligations of a single judge in common law tradition.

In continental civil law systems, while the judge is actively involved in the evidence-taking phase of the proceedings, the final resolution of the case is often entrusted to other judges who were not part of that initial phase. This separation is designed to enhance impartiality and fairness in the judicial process. Here's what it means:

> **Separation of Roles in the Judicial Process**
>
> 1. **Evidence-Taking Judge (Investigating Judge):**
>    - **Active Involvement in Evidence Gathering:** This judge conducts the investigation by collecting documents, interviewing witnesses, and overseeing the compilation of all relevant evidence.
>    - **Procedural Oversight:** They manage pre-trial procedures, address preliminary issues, and ensure that the evidence is gathered according to legal standards.
>    - **Neutral Facilitator:** Their role is to impartially collect all pertinent information without making judgments about the outcome.
>
> 2. **Deciding Judge(s):**
>    - **Reviewing the Collected Evidence:** The deciding judge or panel reviews the evidence compiled during the investigation phase.
>    - **Conducting the Trial:** They preside over the trial proceedings, hear legal arguments from both parties, and may allow for additional evidence or witness testimonies if necessary.
>    - **Rendering Judgment:** Based on the reviewed evidence and applicable law, they make a final decision on the case.
>
> **Reasons for the Separation**
>
> - **Impartiality and Objectivity:**
>   - **Avoiding Bias:** Judges who have been involved in gathering evidence might develop preconceived notions about the case. By having different judges decide the case, the system aims to prevent any potential bias.
>   - **Fresh Evaluation:** Deciding judges approach the case without prior involvement, allowing for an unbiased assessment of the evidence and arguments.
>
> - **Specialization of Judicial Functions:**
>   - **Efficiency:** Judges can specialize in procedural management or adjudication, enhancing the efficiency and expertise in each phase.
>   - **Complex Cases Management:** In cases with extensive or complex evidence, specialized judges can more effectively handle the intricacies of evidence collection.
>
> **Examples in Civil Law Systems**
>
> 1. **France:**
>    - **Juge de la Mise en État (Pre-Trial Judge):**
>      - Handles pre-trial matters, including evidence gathering and procedural issues.
>      - Does not participate in the final decision unless the case is straightforward and the parties agree.
>    - **Trial Judges:**
>      - A different judge or panel conducts the trial and renders the judgment based on the compiled evidence.
>
> 2. **Germany:**
>    - **Single Judge Proceedings:**
>      - In lower courts, a single judge may handle all aspects, but in higher courts or complex cases, roles may be divided.
>    - **Chambers with Multiple Judges:**
>      - A rapporteur judge may be responsible for preparing the case, but the final decision is made collectively by the chamber judges.
>
> 3. **Italy:**
>    - **Giudice Istruttore (Instructing Judge):**
>      - Oversees the preparatory phase, manages evidence collection, and addresses procedural matters.
>    - **Deciding Judge(s):**
>      - Another judge or panel takes over for the trial phase to decide the case based on the instruction judge's dossier.
>
> **Implications for the Judicial Process**
>
> - **Enhanced Fairness:**
>   - **Defendant's Rights Protection:** Ensures that the defendant receives a fair trial by judges who have not formed opinions during the evidence collection.
>   - **Balanced Evaluation:** Both parties can present their arguments to judges who assess the case solely on the merits presented during the trial.
>
> - **Procedural Safeguards:**
>   - **Transparency:** Clear separation of duties makes the process more transparent and understandable for the parties involved.
>   - **Checks and Balances:** The system provides internal checks by having multiple judges involved at different stages.
>
> **Contrast with Common Law Systems**
>
> - **Unified Judicial Role:**
>   - In common law jurisdictions, the same judge (or jury) typically oversees the entire process, from evidence presentation to final judgment.
>   - **Adversarial Nature:** The parties are responsible for presenting evidence, and the judge acts as an impartial referee rather than an active investigator.
>
> **Benefits of the Separation**
>
> - **Objective Decision-Making:**
>   - Judges deciding the case do so without any prior involvement, ensuring decisions are based solely on the evidence and arguments presented during the trial phase.
>
> - **Efficiency and Expertise:**
>   - Allows for procedural efficiency by assigning evidence collection to judges specialized in that area.
>   - Deciding judges can focus on legal analysis and application of the law without the procedural burdens of evidence gathering.
>
> **Potential Challenges**
>
> - **Communication Gaps:**
>   - Ensuring that the deciding judges fully understand the context and nuances of the evidence collected by another judge may require careful management.
>
> - **Extended Timelines:**
>   - Transferring cases between judges can introduce additional steps, potentially affecting the speed of proceedings.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> In continental civil law systems, the practice of having judges other than those involved in evidence-taking resolve the case is a structural approach to uphold judicial impartiality and fairness. By separating the investigative and adjudicative functions, the system seeks to prevent biases that could arise from a judge's involvement in evidence gathering. This ensures that the final decision is made by judges who evaluate the case objectively, based on the evidence and legal arguments presented during the trial phase. This method reflects the civil law tradition's emphasis on a fair and just legal process, balancing thorough investigation with impartial adjudication.

The continental and common civil procedure uses written and oral arguments respectively. For example, during the witness testimony in common civil procedure the questions are asked orally by the advocates of both parties, whereas it is compulsory for the continental advocate to propose a question in written form to judge who can either accept or reject it. This example illustrates not only the difference in common and continental civil procedure in terms of oral or written arguments but also in the presence of cross-examination. In other words, cross-examination does not take place in continental civil procedure.

Civil procedures in Common and Continental Legal Systems differ in terms of parties who incur counsel fees. In the former case, except for England, counsel fees must be paid by each party regardless of the case’s outcome. On the other hand, in civil law countries, the loser covers the winner’s counsel fees.

A civil case trial in a civil law system is distinct from that in common law jurisdictions due to differences in legal traditions and procedural approaches. Civil law systems are prevalent in continental Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, and Asia. They are based on codified statutes and legal codes rather than case law precedents.

> Here is an overview of how a civil case trial typically unfolds in a civil law system:
>
> 1. **Initiation of the Lawsuit:**
>    - **Filing the Complaint:** The plaintiff submits a written complaint to the court, outlining the facts and legal basis for the claim.
>    - **Service of Process:** The court serves the complaint to the defendant, who is then required to respond within a specified time frame.
>
> 2. **Written Pleadings:**
>    - **Exchange of Documents:** Both parties exchange written submissions, including the complaint, defense, counterclaims, and replies.
>    - **Emphasis on Documentation:** The initial stages focus heavily on written evidence and legal arguments submitted to the court.
>
> 3. **Role of the Judge:**
>    - **Active Judicial Role:** The judge plays an inquisitorial role, actively managing the proceedings and investigating the facts.
>    - **Case Management:** The judge identifies the legal and factual issues, orders the production of evidence, and may even question witnesses directly.
>    - **Neutral Fact-Finder:** Unlike in common law systems, the judge seeks to uncover the truth rather than merely adjudicate between opposing parties.
>
> 4. **Evidence Gathering:**
>    - **Limited Discovery Process:** Pre-trial discovery is less extensive, with the court controlling the evidence-gathering process.
>    - **Court-Appointed Experts:** Experts may be appointed by the court to provide impartial opinions on technical matters.
>    - **Written Evidence:** There is a greater reliance on documents and written expert reports over oral testimony.
>
> 5. **Hearings and Oral Proceedings:**
>    - **Structured Hearings:** Hearings are often more formal and shorter, focusing on clarifying points from the written submissions.
>    - **Judge-Led Questioning:** The judge conducts the questioning of parties and witnesses, with limited cross-examination by lawyers.
>    - **Minimal Witness Testimony:** Oral testimonies are less emphasized, and witness statements may be submitted in writing.
>
> 6. **Legal Representation:**
>    - **Advisory Role of Lawyers:** Attorneys assist in preparing written submissions and may present legal arguments but have a less adversarial role during hearings.
>    - **Collaboration Over Confrontation:** The process encourages cooperation to establish the facts rather than adversarial contention.
>
> 7. **Decision and Judgment:**
>    - **Written Judgment:** The judge issues a detailed written decision, explaining the legal reasoning and application of the law.
>    - **No Jury System:** Civil cases are decided by judges without the involvement of a jury.
>
> 8. **Appeals Process:**
>    - **Right to Appeal:** Parties can appeal the decision to a higher court, which may review both factual and legal aspects.
>    - **De Novo Review:** Appellate courts may re-examine the case entirely, not just the legal interpretations.
>
> 9. **Costs and Fees:**
>    - **Loser Pays Principle:** The losing party is often required to pay the legal costs of the winning party, including court fees and attorney fees.
>
> **Key Characteristics of Civil Law Trials:**
>
> - **Codified Laws:** Legal codes provide a comprehensive set of rules that judges apply to cases.
> - **Inquisitorial System:** The judge actively investigates the facts, reducing the burden on the parties to present evidence.
> - **Reduced Precedent Reliance:** Past judicial decisions have persuasive value but are not binding precedents as in common law systems.
> - **Efficiency and Predictability:** The structured process aims for a swift resolution, with clear procedural rules reducing uncertainty.
>
> **Examples by Country:**
>
> - **France:** The French civil procedure emphasizes written submissions, with judges playing a central role in gathering and assessing evidence.
> - **Germany:** German courts focus on written documents and have a procedural code that guides the judge's active involvement.
> - **Japan:** While influenced by both civil and common law traditions, Japan's civil procedure aligns more with the civil law model, emphasizing judge-led proceedings.
>
> **Conclusion:**
>
> A civil case trial in a civil law system is characterized by an active judicial role, a focus on written evidence, and a less adversarial atmosphere. The judge directs the proceedings to uncover the truth, applying codified laws to reach a decision. This approach aims to enhance efficiency, reduce litigation costs, and provide a predictable legal environment.

### Criminal procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems

A lot of differences in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems discussed above can be applied to criminal procedure as well. The explanation beyond this is what tradition, adversarial or inquisitorial, the Legal System follows. For example, the role of impartial referee assigned to the judge in common civil procedure is the same for judge in common criminal procedure. Alternatively, in both continental civil and criminal cases the judge acts as an inquisitor. Moreover, the witness testimony in criminal procedure of both legal systems follows the same pattern as in civil procedure. However, there are some distinctive differences which uniquely determine criminal procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems.

First of all, the criminal case in Common Legal System is initiated by the wronged person, his relatives or any other member of the society. A presiding officer is appointed then to hear and decide the case. By contrast, the private accuser in continental criminal procedure is replaced by public official, who represents the State’s interests. In other words, the contest has shifted from two individuals to an individual and the State.

Secondly, the difference can be found in examining phase of criminal proceeding. At this stage the evidences are collected followed by compilation of the dossier. While it is allowed to disclose the dossier to the defense in continental criminal proceeding it is prohibited in common legal proceeding.

Thirdly, in common criminal procedure the defendant must be sworn and can not refuse to answer while being questioned. On the contrary, this practice is not applied to criminal justice system in continental countries where the case is exactly the opposite.

Another important difference in criminal procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems is plea bargaining. In contrast to common criminal procedure where plea bargaining is a distinctive feature, the prosecutor power is limited in continental countries. Moreover, in common countries “the defendant who pleads guilty forgoes a trial”. In civil countries, however, the plea guilty is not a hard evidence for defendant’s guilt. Therefore, the trial necessary takes place.

Finally, it is wrongly believed that there are no concepts of jury trial and presumption of innocence in civil criminal proceedings. In fact, “a legal presumption of innocence does exist in many civil law jurisdictions”, although in some civil countries it may not exist as a formal rule of law. Similarly, the jury trial is replaced with lay advisers. However, the verdict of lay advisers is not always a conclusive ruling for the defendant to be accused or acquitted.

> **==Lay Advisers== in Criminal Cases in Civil Law Systems**
>
> In criminal cases within civil law systems, **lay advisers**—also known as **lay judges** or **lay assessors**—are non-professional individuals who participate in the judicial process alongside professional judges. They serve a role similar to jurors in common law systems but function differently within the court proceedings.
>
> **Understanding the Role of Lay Advisers**
>
> 1. **Replacement of Jury Trials:**
>    - **No Traditional Jury:** Many civil law countries do not use juries composed solely of laypeople to determine a defendant's guilt or innocence.
>    - **Lay Judges Instead of Juries:** Instead, they incorporate lay advisers into the judicial panel, integrating citizens directly into the decision-making process.
>
> 2. **Participation in the Judicial Panel:**
>    - **Collaborative Decision-Making:** Lay advisers sit with professional judges during trials, hear all the evidence, and participate in deliberations.
>    - **Voting Rights:** They have the right to vote on the verdict and, in some cases, on sentencing decisions.
>    - **Community Representation:** Their involvement brings societal perspectives and values into the courtroom, promoting transparency and public trust in the judicial system.
>
> 3. **Non-Conclusive Verdicts:**
>    - **Collective Verdicts:** Decisions are made collectively by the panel of judges, which includes both lay and professional members.
>    - **Influence of Professional Judges:** While lay advisers contribute to the verdict, professional judges often have significant influence due to their legal expertise.
>    - **No Sole Authority:** The verdict is not solely determined by the lay advisers; it results from the combined judgment of all panel members.
>
> 4. **Presumption of Innocence:**
>    - **Fundamental Principle:** The presumption of innocence exists in many civil law jurisdictions, ensuring that defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty.
>    - **Legal Implementation:** Even if not explicitly codified, this principle is upheld through judicial practices and procedural safeguards.
>
> **Examples in Civil Law Countries**
>
> 1. **Germany:**
>    - **Schöffen (Lay Judges):**
>      - In certain criminal cases, two lay judges join one or more professional judges.
>      - **Equal Voting Rights:** Lay judges have equal say in verdicts and sentencing.
>      - **Deliberation Process:** Decisions require a majority; professional judges do not have overriding authority but may influence deliberations through legal reasoning.
>
> 2. **France:**
>    - **Cour d'Assises (Criminal Court for Serious Offenses):**
>      - Consists of three professional judges and six or nine lay jurors (depending on the severity of the case).
>      - **Verdict Requirements:**
>        - A supermajority (e.g., 8 out of 12 votes) may be required for conviction in serious cases.
>      - **Joint Deliberation:** Professional judges and lay jurors deliberate together, blending legal expertise with public opinion.
>
> 3. **Japan:**
>    - **Saiban-in System (Lay Judge System):**
>      - In serious criminal cases, six lay judges work alongside three professional judges.
>      - **Decision-Making:**
>        - Verdicts and sentences are determined by majority vote, which must include at least one professional judge.
>      - **Purpose:** Aims to increase public participation and confidence in the legal system.
>
> **Key Points to Understand**
>
> - **Integration of Lay Participation:**
>   - Civil law systems incorporate lay advisers to involve ordinary citizens directly in the judicial process, differing from the separate jury system in common law countries.
>
> - **Collective Decision-Making:**
>   - Verdicts are the result of collaborative deliberation between lay advisers and professional judges, combining legal knowledge with societal perspectives.
>
> - **Role in Ensuring Fairness:**
>   - The inclusion of lay advisers helps ensure that legal decisions are grounded in community values and that the judicial process remains transparent and accountable.
>
> - **Presumption of Innocence:**
>   - Despite misconceptions, civil law systems generally uphold the presumption of innocence, providing defendants with fundamental protections throughout the trial.
>
> **Understanding the Misconception**
>
> - **No Juries Doesn't Mean No Public Participation:**
>   - The absence of a traditional jury trial does not imply that civil law systems lack public involvement; they simply integrate laypersons differently.
>
> - **Verdict Influence:**
>   - While lay advisers contribute significantly, the final verdict is a collective decision, preventing any single group from having undue influence over the outcome.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> In criminal cases within civil law systems, lay advisers serve as an integral part of the judicial panel, working alongside professional judges to decide cases. They replace the traditional jury found in common law systems, providing a means for public participation and helping to ground legal decisions in community values. While they share in the decision-making process, their verdicts are part of a collective outcome and not solely determinative. This system upholds principles like the presumption of innocence and seeks to balance legal expertise with societal input, ensuring fair and transparent judicial proceedings.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I would like to say that as our world tends to move toward globalization the borders between Continental and Common Law Legal systems, and as a result, between procedures of those systems become feebly marked. As an example, Continental Legal System has started to rely more on previous cases whereas a lot of importance is attached to statutes in modern common law countries. Base themselves upon that fact, a lot of legal scholars speak out in support of convergence theory which suggests a creation of single legislation for all countries throughout the world. Will this theory ever become a reality? Time will show. However, to my point of view, before it becomes possible we have to reach the convergence of cultures, ideologies, moral values and political attitudes.

## Common law system

### Comparisons of modern English, American, and Commonwealth law

The legal systems rooted in the English common law have diverged from their parent system so greatly over time that, in many areas, the legal approaches of common-law countries differ as much from one another as they do from civil-law countries. Indeed, England and the United States have so many legal differences that they are sometimes described as “two countries separated by a common law.” The most striking differences are found in the area of public law. England has no written constitution and restricts judicial review, whereas every court in the United States possesses the power to pass judgment on the conformity of legislation and on other official actions to constitutional norms. Throughout the 20th century and beyond, many areas of U.S. law were “constitutionalized” by the increasing exercise of judicial power. Other factors that account for much of the distinctiveness of public law in the United States include its complex federal system and its presidential, rather than parliamentary, form of government. In the area of private law, however, family resemblances between the common-law systems are much greater. Yet even there, despite broad basic similarities, the common-law countries have developed distinctive variations over time.

### Personal law

The law of personal status (nationality, capacity, domicile, etc.) has been transformed by the advancement of the principle of equality of the sexes. In the area of divorce law, the intense legislative activity of the 1960s and ’70s left most common-law countries with systems of “mixed grounds” for divorce. One can obtain a divorce based upon the fault of the other spouse or upon some no-fault ground, such as separation or breakdown of the marriage. Some American states have eliminated fault grounds entirely. The major differences between common-law systems appear in the legal treatment of the economic consequences of divorce. Most common-law countries follow the English model that permits judges to use their own discretion in reallocating the property and income of the spouses in a way that seems fair, whereas some American states adhere to the principle of equal rather than discretionary division of assets. Following the Supreme Court’s decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015), same-sex marriages became legal in the United States. Same-sex marriages were legalized in England and Wales in 2013 and in Scotland in 2014.

### Property and succession

The basic principles of property and succession are much the same everywhere, but the newer countries have special laws on forests, mines, and water rights. In Australia, for example, the crown reserves all mineral rights to itself. The transfer of land in England is governed by a system of title registration. In Canada and the United States, the separate deeds are recorded and title insurance is widely used to protect the purchaser. In England since the 1960s, there has been a significant development of the law relating to restitution, the right to recover property mistakenly transferred to another. Owing nothing to statute and much to the writings of academic lawyers, this demonstrates the continued liveliness of the common-law tradition of decision-based legal development.

Succession on intestacy is broadly similar throughout common-law countries but varies everywhere in detail. The widow, for example, may get more in one country and the children more in another. All children of both sexes generally take equal shares. In regard to intestate succession, nearly all American states protect the surviving spouse against disinheritance by securing to him or her a fixed indefeasible share of the decedent’s estate. In England and most Commonwealth countries, however, not only the spouse but also children and certain other dependents of the deceased are permitted to petition the court for discretionary financial provision out of an estate if, in the judgment of the court, the testator did not make reasonable provision for them.

> **Succession on intestacy** is the legal process that determines how a deceased person's estate is distributed when they die **without a valid will**. In such cases, the estate is divided according to the laws of intestate succession, which vary by jurisdiction but generally prioritize close relatives. Typically, assets are allocated to the surviving spouse, children, parents, siblings, or more distant relatives in a specific order defined by statute. This means the deceased's personal wishes are not considered, and the estate is distributed based on the legal hierarchy established by the state or country.

In most American states and some Canadian provinces, there are homestead laws, which protect the family house or a certain minimum sum of money from the claims of creditors.

> **Homestead laws** are statutes designed to protect a homeowner's primary residence from certain types of creditors, property taxes, and circumstances like the death of a spouse. These laws provide financial safeguards by:

> 1. **Exempting a Portion of Home Equity**: They allow homeowners to exempt a specific amount of their home's value from claims by unsecured creditors, reducing the risk of losing their homes due to debt.
>
> 2. **Offering Property Tax Relief**: Some homestead laws include tax exemptions that lower property taxes for eligible homeowners, such as seniors, veterans, or those with disabilities.
>
> 3. **Protecting Surviving Family Members**: They ensure that a spouse or minor children can continue to live in the family home after the death of the homeowner, preventing forced sales.
>
> **Key Points:**
>
> - **Variation by Jurisdiction**: Homestead laws differ significantly between countries and even among states within the U.S., with varying exemption amounts and eligibility criteria.
>
> - **Automatic or Application Required**: In some places, homestead protection is automatic upon purchasing a home, while in others, homeowners must file a declaration to receive the benefits.
>
> - **Limitations**: Homestead exemptions typically do not protect against all creditors (e.g., mortgages, taxes, or mechanic's liens) and have limits on the amount of equity protected.
>
> **Example**:
>
> - **Texas**: Offers one of the most generous homestead protections in the U.S., allowing homeowners to exempt the entire value of their primary residence from most creditors.
>
> **Purpose**:
>
> Homestead laws aim to promote family stability, encourage homeownership, and provide a safety net that prevents individuals from becoming homeless due to economic hardship or the death of a family member.

### Tort law

Tort law (i.e., the law relating to private civil wrongs) is largely common law, as opposed to statute-based law, in England, Canada, and the United States. Several major reforms have been introduced along the same lines in different countries. Allowing claims by dependents of persons tortuously killed and removing the immunity of the crown or government or charitable institutions from tort claims provide examples. The liability of manufacturers to the ultimate consumer was first laid down by U.S. and then by English judges. After a slow start (compared with Europe), the protection of employees proceeded apace in the United States in the second half of the 20th century so as to cover almost any accident occasioned in the workplace, however unrelated to the employer’s business or fault. In the wider world also, the growth of insurance subtly affected tort law by shifting liability to those most able to pay for coverage.

In the field of libel, U.S. practice is less strict than the English. In the United States public figures cannot sue for honest but unfair and untrue criticisms of their activities, whereas in England published facts must be true and comments fair. In some Australian states truth is not necessarily a defense to an action.

A notable U.S. tort is interference with privacy. Examples include a stranger’s using one’s photograph for advertising without permission, using electronic eavesdropping in one’s home or searching it, or taking photographs of persons in embarrassing situations. In England privacy is still seen as related to commercial considerations; it is possible to buy privacy but not to enjoy it as a right.

### Contracts

Contract law is basically similar in the common-law countries. The most interesting difference relates to the question of enforcement of contracts by third parties who are not actually parties to the contract but are persons for whose benefit the contract was made. English law excludes such rights, except in an occasional statute. The Indian Contract Code of 1872 generally allows it, as does U.S. state law. In all countries, legislation now protects consumers against the power of large commercial corporations and regulates the operation of credit transactions.

English law has largely repealed the laws requiring written evidence of ordinary contracts, sometimes to the surprise of consumers. Written evidence is often called for in the United States.

The various areas of special contracts, such as those applying to employment, sale of land, and agency, are broadly similar everywhere but are regulated by local legislation and by a wealth of labour legislation.

### Criminal law and procedure

In regard to criminal law, the substance of the law is much the same throughout the common-law countries. In both the United Kingdom and the United States, the 20th century was a period during which it was thought that undesirable behaviour could be eliminated by rigorous law enforcement. In the early part of the century, this led to the criminalization of much personal behaviour—including some sexual practices, gambling, and the use of alcohol and drugs—that was previously beyond the reach of the law, the most noteworthy example being the prohibition of alcoholic beverages in the United States from 1919 to 1933. At the beginning of the 21st century, some such behaviours were being treated as medical or psychological problems rather than as criminal ones.

The death penalty, which had been slowly removed in most U.S. states since the end of the 19th century, was revived during the 1970s after the Supreme Court ruled its use constitutional. Capital punishment was eliminated in the United Kingdom in 1965.

More important differences appear in the rules of criminal procedure. In England, this rests on modern legislation. Accused persons may now testify at the trial or not, as they wish; they are entitled to legal counsel; and they are assisted out of public funds when they are accused of serious crimes and are unable to afford to pay the costs themselves.

Canada has a Dominion Criminal Code, which covers major crimes. It also has a Canadian Bill of Rights and provincial laws, such as the Ontario Human Rights Code. India has an overriding Bill of Rights.

In the United States criminal procedure has become a constitutional matter, with a kind of federal common law of criminal procedure overriding state law in many instances. Thus, due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure confer protection on accused persons.

English courts are reluctant to admit recordings of private conversations unless supported by direct evidence of persons present, and this is generally the position taken in the United States, although emergency wiretapping and other electronic monitoring are permitted with the permission of a court or in some cases involving national security. The USA PATRIOT Act (2001) and subsequent reauthorizations significantly expanded the search and surveillance powers of law-enforcement agencies in the United States to include limited monitoring of telephone and electronic communications without probable cause (a showing of facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the surveillance would likely uncover evidence of criminal activity). English and U.S. law generally exclude confessions unless they are made freely and spontaneously. If evidence is found by unlawful means—such as by searching a house without a warrant—English law permits such evidence to be used, but U.S. law generally does not, though significant exceptions were created by the Supreme Court from the late 20th century. The main difference between English and U.S. safeguards is that English protections rest on statute or case law and may be changed by ordinary statute, whereas U.S. safeguards are constitutional and cannot be relaxed unless the Supreme Court later reverses its interpretation or the Constitution is amended.

### The future of the common law

In the past, the law performed the function of a referee in a free economy and was called in to apply generally accepted ideas of right and wrong to individual disputes. Today, law often forms an instrument of governmental policy or results from social pressures on the government. Law, therefore, is increasingly administrative.

Another tendency, and one that is likely to be reinforced, is an increasing reliance on statute law and codification as instruments of legal development. At one time the English Law Commission considered drafting a contract code, and the law of tort has been the subject of several statutes. When the United Kingdom entered the European Economic Community, it was thought that there might be pressures to make English law more accessible by codifying it along the lines of the continental model. Harmonization of the laws of the member states, however, did not require this, and Britain’s withdrawal from the EU in 2020 made the point moot. The introduction of human rights as a basic element in the domestic law of the United Kingdom has brought about change, as has the growth of international tribunals. In the United States the legal sovereignty of the states impedes such a radical change, but uniform state laws are becoming more common.

In view of the general tendency in modern society of shielding the individual as fully as possible from the consequences of chance accidents, the judge-made law of tort may eventually be replaced, as it was for a time in New Zealand, by a comprehensive system of official or private insurance similar to the present compulsory third-party risk insurance available for motor vehicles. The New Zealand experience, however, suggests that this is an expensive alternative. Public law is also gaining on private law in other fields—in real-property development, for example, public zoning or urban planning rules are already more important than the traditional restrictions imposed by individual neighbouring landowners. Public-welfare laws on child care and adoption, pensions, and social security are often more important than the older private law based on the rights of spouses and children.

English and American law can still be recognized as partners sharing a common root in the common law before the 18th century. But they are increasingly diverging, and English law, with or without the European Union, now shows much more specific similarities to the law in other countries of continental Europe than would hitherto have been admitted.

### Example of anglo-saxon system:  Miranda v. Arizona (June 13, 1966)

#### Facts

The Supreme Court’s decision in Miranda v. Arizona addressed four different cases involving custodial interrogations. In each of these cases, the defendant was questioned by police officers, detectives, or a prosecuting attorney in a room in which he was cut off from the outside world. In none of these cases was the defendant given a full and effective warning of his rights at the outset of the interrogation process. In all the cases, the questioning elicited oral admissions and, in three of them, signed statements that were admitted at trial.

- Miranda v. Arizona: Miranda was arrested at his home and taken in custody to a police station where he was identified by the complaining witness. He was then interrogated by two police officers for two hours, which resulted in a signed, written confession. At trial, the oral and written confessions were presented to the jury. Miranda was found guilty of kidnapping and rape and was sentenced to 20-30 years imprisonment on each count. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that Miranda’s constitutional rights were not violated in obtaining the confession.

#### Issues

Whether “statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation” are admissible against him in a criminal trial and whether “procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself” are necessary.

#### Supreme Court holding

The Court held that “there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.” As such, “the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.”

The Court further held that “without proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual’s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would otherwise do so freely.” Therefore, a defendant “must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.”

The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona in Miranda, reversed the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals in Vignera, reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Westover, and affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of California in Stewart.

Miranda v. Arizona: After Miranda’s conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court, the State of Arizona retried him. At the second trial, Miranda’s confession was not introduced into evidence. Miranda was once again convicted and sentenced to 20-30 years in prison.

## Chinese law system

China’s laws and regulations can be divided into four levels in terms of effectiveness in a descending hierarchy:

1. The Constitution;
2. Laws;
3. Administrative regulations, judicial interpretation, military regulations;
4. Local laws and regulations, departmental regulations.

![Chinese Legal System](Images/chinese_legal_system.jpg "Chinese Legal System")

### What’s the Chinese legal system?

According to China’s Constitution and the Legislation Law, the effectiveness levels (from high to low) and the authorities enacting the above laws and regulations are as follows:

- Level 1:

  The Constitution, formulated by the National People’s Congress (NPC), prevails over all other laws and regulations.

- Level 2:

  The Laws are formulated by the NPC (basic laws) and its Standing Committee (general laws).

- Level 3:

  1. Administrative regulations are formulated by the State Council (i.e., the central government).
  2. Judicial interpretations (see above) are formulated by the Supreme People’s Court (SPC) and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate (SPP).
  3. Military regulations are formulated by the Central Military Commission (CMC).

- Level 4:

  1. Local laws and regulations are formulated by the Provincial People’s Congress and its Standing Committee, with the effect covering the areas under its jurisdiction;
  2. Departmental regulations are formulated by the departments directly under the State Council, with the effect covering the national matters falling within their functions and powers.

### Legislation

The Legislation Law was promulgated in 2000 and amended in 2015 respectively. The latest revision entered into force on March 15, 2015.

There are 105 articles in total.

The key points are as follows:

1. This Law shall apply to the enactment, amendment, and repeal of laws, administrative regulations, local regulations, autonomous regulations, and separate regulations.

2. The National People’s Congress and its Standing Committee shall exercise the legislative power of the State.

3. The National People’s Congress shall enact and amend the basic laws on criminal matters, civil matters, and state authorities, among others.

4. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress shall enact and amend laws other than those developed by the National People’s Congress.

5. The State Council shall enact administrative regulations in accordance with the Constitution and laws. The following matters may be governed by administrative regulations:

   1. matters requiring the development of administrative regulations to implement the provisions of laws;
   2. matters within the administrative functions and powers of the State Council as set out in Article 89 of the Constitution.

6. The people’s congress and its standing committee of a province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government may, according to the specific circumstances and actual needs of the administrative region, enact local regulations, provided that such regulations do not contravene the Constitution, laws, and administrative regulations.

7. The ministries and commissions of the State Council, the People’s Bank of China, the State Audit Administration, and other divisions with administrative functions directly under the State Council may, in accordance with the laws and the administrative regulations, decisions, and orders of the State Council, enact rules within their respective power.

8. The hierarchy of legal effects:

   1. The Constitution shall have the supreme legal effect;
   2. the effect of laws shall be higher than that of administrative regulations, local regulations, and rules;
   3. the effect of administrative regulations shall be higher than that of local regulations and rules;
   4. the effect of local regulations shall be higher than that of the rules of local governments at the same level and at a lower level;
   5. the effect of the rules enacted by the people’s government of a province or autonomous region is higher than that of the rules enacted by the people’s government of a districted city or an autonomous prefecture within the administrative region of the province or autonomous region;
   6. the rules of different departments of the State Council shall be equally effective;
   7. the laws, administrative regulations, local regulations, autonomous regulations, separate regulations, and rules shall not be retroactive, except for the special provisions developed for the better protection of the rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations.

### Judicial interpretation

Judicial interpretation is a series of binding rules formulated by the Supreme People’s Court (SPC) and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate (SPP).

Judicial interpretation is the official interpretation made by the SPC and the SPP on the application of certain laws, and, therefore, has legal binding force.

The power of the SPC and the SPP to formulate judicial interpretation derives from the provisions of China’s Legislation Law (立法法). According to the Legislation Law, the judicial interpretation of the SPC and the SPP should be made for specific legal provisions, and it should conform to the legislative purpose, principle and original intention of the legal provisions in question.

In order to make it clear how to formulate judicial interpretation, the SPC promulgated the Provisions of the Supreme People’s Court on Judicial Interpretation (最高人民法院关于司法解释工作的规定) in 2007. Likewise, the SPP also promulgated the Provisions of the Supreme People’s Procuratorate on Judicial Interpretation (最高人民检察院司法解释工作规定) in 2006, as amended in 2015 and 2019.

The SPC’s judicial interpretation covers matters in civil and commercial law, criminal law and administrative law, while the SPP’s judicial interpretation mainly focuses on criminal cases. As for foreign parties, civil and commercial disputes are of their utmost concern in their contacts with China, so we will mainly introduce how the SPC formulate the judicial interpretation.

In addition, it should be noted that once the SPC’s judicial interpretation being implemented, all courts nationwide are bound by it. If a court makes a judgment based on the judicial interpretation, it shall invoke the judicial interpretation in the judgment.

## Islamic law system

**Sharia**, the fundamental religious concept of Islam—namely, its law.

The religious law of Islam is seen as the expression of God’s command for Muslims and, in application, constitutes a system of duties that are incumbent upon all Muslims by virtue of their religious belief. Known as the sharīʿah (literally, “path leading to the watering place”), the law represents a divinely ordained path of conduct that guides Muslims toward a practical expression of religious conviction in this world and the goal of divine favour in the world to come.

### Nature and significance of Islamic law

In classical form, the sharia differs from Western systems of law in two principal respects. In the first place, the scope of the sharia is much wider, since it regulates the individual’s relationship not only with neighbours and with the state, which is the limit of most other legal systems, but also with God and with the individual’s own conscience. Ritual practices—such as the daily prayers (ṣalāt), almsgiving (zakāt), fasting (ṣawm), and pilgrimage (hajj)—are an integral part of sharia law and usually occupy the first chapters in legal manuals. The sharia is concerned as much with ethical standards as with legal rules, indicating not only what an individual is entitled or bound to do in law but also what one ought, in conscience, to do or to refrain from doing. Accordingly, certain acts are classified as praiseworthy (mandūb), which means that their performance brings divine favour and their omission divine disfavour, and others as blameworthy (makrūh), which has the opposite implications. However, in neither case is there any legal sanction of punishment or reward, nullity or validity. The sharia is thus not merely a system of law but also a comprehensive code of behaviour that embraces both private and public activities.

The second major distinction between the sharia and Western legal systems is a consequence of the Islamic concept of the law as the expression of the divine will. With the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632, direct communication of the divine will to human beings ceased, and the terms of the divine revelation were henceforth fixed and immutable. The overall image of the sharia is thus one of unchanging continuity, an impression that generally holds true for some areas of the law, such as ritual law. However, revelation can be interpreted in varying ways, and, over time, the diversity of possible interpretations has produced a wide array of positions on almost every point of law. In the premodern period the ʿulamāʾ (Muslim religious scholars) held a monopoly over interpretation of the law, but since the 19th century their monopoly has been challenged by Westernized elites and laypeople. The question of which interpretations become normative at any given time is complex. Early Western studies of Islamic law held the view that while Islamic law shaped Muslim societies, the latter had no influence on Islamic law in return. However, this position has become untenable. Social pressures and communal interests have played an important role in determining the practice of Islamic law in particular contexts—both in the premodern period and to an even greater extent in the modern era.

### The substance of traditional sharia law

Sharia duties are broadly divided into those that an individual owes to God (the ritual practices, or ʿibādāt) and those that the individual owes to other human beings (interpersonal matters, or muʿāmalāt). Only the latter category of duties, which constitutes law in the Western sense, is described here.

#### Penal law

Offenses against another person, from homicide to assault, are punishable by retaliation (qiṣāṣ), the offender being subject to precisely the same treatment as the victim. This type of offense is regarded as a civil injury rather than a crime in the technical sense, since it is not the state but only the victim or the victim’s family who has the right to prosecute and to opt for compensation or blood money (diyah) in place of retaliation.

For a handful of specific crimes, the punishment is fixed (ḥadd): death for apostasy, amputation of the hand for theft and of the hand and foot for highway robbery, death by stoning for extramarital sexual relations (zinā) when the offender is married and 100 lashes when the offender is unmarried, and 80 lashes for an unproved accusation of unchastity (qadhf) and for the drinking of any intoxicant.

Beyond the ḥadd crimes, both the determination of offenses and decisions regarding the punishment meted out for them lie within the discretion of the executive or the courts.

#### Law of transactions

A legal capacity to transact belongs to any person “of prudent judgment” (rāshid), a quality that is normally deemed to accompany physical maturity or puberty. The law presumes that:

1. boys below the age of 12 and girls below the age of 9 have not attained puberty and;
2. by the age of 15 puberty has been attained for both sexes.

Persons who are not rāshid, on account of minority or mental deficiency, are placed under interdiction: their affairs are managed by a guardian, and they cannot transact effectively without the guardian’s consent.

The basic principles of the law are laid down in the four root transactions:

1. sale (bayʿ), transfer of the ownership or corpus of property for a consideration;
2. hire (ijārah), transfer of the usufruct (right to use) of property for a consideration;
3. gift (hibah), gratuitous transfer of the corpus of property, and
4. loan (ʿāriyah), gratuitous transfer of the usufruct of property.

These basic principles are then applied to the various specific transactions of, for example, pledge, deposit, guarantee, agency, assignment, land tenancy, partnership, and charitable foundations (waqf). Waqf is a uniquely Islamic institution in which founders relinquish their ownership of real property to God and dedicate the income or usufruct of the property in perpetuity to some pious or charitable purpose. This may include settlements in favour of the founder’s own family.

The doctrine of ribā significantly influences the Islamic law of transactions. Basically, this is the prohibition of usury, but the notion of ribā was rigorously extended to cover, and therefore preclude, any form of interest on a capital loan or investment. And since this doctrine was coupled with the general prohibition on gambling transactions, Islamic law does not, in general, permit any kind of speculative transaction the results of which, in terms of the material benefits accruing to the parties, cannot be precisely forecast.

> **Buying Stocks According to Sharia Law**

>    - Investments should avoid companies heavily reliant on interest-based income.
>
> 2. **Avoidance of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty) and Maysir (Gambling):**
>    - Investments should not involve excessive risk or speculative practices.
>    - Transactions must be clear, with all terms agreed upon upfront.
>
> 3. **Exclusion of Haram (Prohibited) Activities:**
>    - Companies involved in alcohol, gambling, pork products, pornography, tobacco, and conventional financial services (like traditional banking and insurance) are to be avoided.
>
> **Conditions for Permissible Stock Investments**
>
> 1. **Primary Business Must Be Halal:**
>    - The company's main activities should be permissible under Sharia law.
>    - Sectors like technology, manufacturing, healthcare, and education are typically acceptable.
>
> 2. **Financial Screening Criteria:**
>    - **Debt Ratio:** The company's total interest-bearing debt should not exceed a certain percentage of its total assets or market capitalization (commonly benchmarked at 33%).
>    - **Interest Income:** Income from non-compliant activities should be minimal (often less than 5% of total revenue).
>    - **Liquidity Ratio:** Some scholars recommend that the company's illiquid assets should be greater than its liquid assets to prevent the trading of pure money, which can resemble usury.
>
> 3. **Purification Process:**
>    - If a portion of the company's income comes from non-compliant sources, investors should calculate the amount of impermissible income they've received and donate an equivalent amount to charity without expecting a reward.
>

>
> - **Sharia-Compliant Stocks:**
>   - Stocks that have been screened and approved by Sharia scholars.
>   - Many financial institutions and Islamic indexes provide lists of compliant companies.
>
> - **Islamic Mutual Funds and ETFs:**
>   - Funds managed according to Islamic principles.
>   - They pool money to invest in a diversified portfolio of Sharia-compliant stocks.
>
> - **Sukuk (Islamic Bonds):**
>   - Islamic financial certificates similar to bonds but structured to avoid interest payments.

> Muslims are permitted to buy stocks provided the investments adhere to Sharia law. This involves careful selection of companies, avoiding those engaged in prohibited activities, and ensuring that financial dealings do not involve interest or excessive uncertainty. By following these guidelines, Muslim investors can participate in the stock market while remaining true to their religious principles.

#### Family law

A patriarchal outlook is the basis of the traditional Islamic law of family relationships. Fathers have the right to contract their daughters, whether minor or adult, in marriage, but jurists agree that an adult woman who is no longer a virgin must give her explicit consent to a marriage. The question of whether a virgin daughter has the right to object to a marriage contracted for her by her father has been the subject of debate among jurists, given that a widely accepted saying of Muhammad seems to imply this right. Some jurists have held that the daughter’s objection should be taken into account but is not binding, while others have considered such an objection to preclude the marriage. In Ḥanafī and Shiʿi law, an adult woman may conclude her own marriage contract, but her guardian may have the marriage annulled if his ward has married beneath her social status.

> **Major Schools of Islamic Law**
>
> Islamic law, known as **Sharia**, is derived from the Quran and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). Over time, scholars developed different interpretations and methodologies for applying these sources to legal issues, leading to the formation of various **schools of thought (madhhabs)**. The major schools are divided into two main branches: **Sunni** and **Shia**.
>
> **Sunni Schools of Law**
>
> There are four major Sunni madhhabs:
>
> 1. **Ḥanafī School**
>    - **Founder**: Imam Abu Hanifa (699–767 CE)
>    - **Characteristics**: Emphasizes reason and analogy (qiyās) when deriving legal rulings. Known for flexibility and adaptability.
>    - **Geographical Influence**: Widely followed in South Asia (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh), Turkey, the Balkans, Central Asia, and parts of the Arab world.
>
> 2. **Mālikī School**
>    - **Founder**: Imam Malik ibn Anas (711–795 CE)
>    - **Characteristics**: Places great weight on the practices of the people of Medina (amal ahl al-Madina) as a source of Sunnah. Considers public welfare (maslahah) in legal judgments.
>    - **Geographical Influence**: Predominant in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya), West Africa, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula.
>
> 3. **Shāfiʿī School**
>    - **Founder**: Imam Al-Shafi'i (767–820 CE)
>    - **Characteristics**: Systematized the principles of Islamic jurisprudence. Balances the use of Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma'), and analogy.
>    - **Geographical Influence**: Followed in East Africa, Egypt, Yemen, Indonesia, Malaysia, and parts of the Middle East.
>
> 4. **Hanbalī School**
>    - **Founder**: Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780–855 CE)
>    - **Characteristics**: Emphasizes strict adherence to the Quran and Hadith. Uses analogy sparingly and rejects juristic preference.
>    - **Geographical Influence**: Dominant in Saudi Arabia and Qatar; influences Islamic thought in other Gulf countries.
>
> **Shia Schools of Law**
>
> 1. **Jaʿfarī School**
>    - **Founder**: Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (702–765 CE)
>    - **Characteristics**: Based on the teachings of the Prophet and the Twelve Imams. Employs reason (ʿaql) extensively in jurisprudence.
>    - **Geographical Influence**: Main legal school for Shia Muslims, especially in Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Bahrain.
>
> 2. **Zaydī School**
>    - **Founder**: Imam Zayd ibn Ali (695–740 CE)
>    - **Characteristics**: Closely aligned with Sunni jurisprudence, particularly the Hanafi school. Emphasizes the importance of justice and the leadership of a qualified imam.
>    - **Geographical Influence**: Predominant in Yemen.
>
> **Other Notable Schools**
>
> - **Ibadi School**
>   - **Characteristics**: An early Islamic school distinct from both Sunni and Shia branches. Emphasizes the Quran and Hadith but has unique legal interpretations.
>   - **Geographical Influence**: Mainly found in Oman and parts of North and East Africa.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> These schools represent different methodologies in interpreting Islamic law. While they may vary in legal opinions and practices, all aim to apply the principles of Islam to guide the lives of Muslims. The diversity among these schools reflects the rich intellectual tradition within Islamic jurisprudence.

In traditional Islamic family law, husbands have the right of polygamy and may be validly married at the same time to a maximum of four wives. Upon marriage, a husband is obliged to pay his wife a dower, the amount of which may be fixed by agreement or by custom. During the marriage, he is bound to maintain and support her, provided that she shows no recalcitrance toward him. A wife who rejects her husband’s dominion by leaving the family home without just cause forfeits her right to maintenance.

A divorce may be effected simply by the mutual agreement of the spouses. Such a divorce, known as khulʿ, requires the payment of some financial consideration by the wife to the husband for her release—most commonly a return of the dower. In addition, according to all schools except the Ḥanafī school, a wife may obtain a judicial decree of divorce on the grounds of some matrimonial offense committed by the husband, such as cruelty, desertion, or failure to provide. However, the husband alone has the power to terminate a marriage unilaterally by repudiation (ṭalāq) of his wife. Ṭalāq is an extrajudicial process: a husband may repudiate his wife at will, and his motive for doing so is not subject to scrutiny by the court or any other official body. A repudiation repeated three times constitutes a final and irrevocable dissolution of the marriage. However, a single pronouncement may be revoked at will by the husband during the wife’s waiting period (ʿiddah), which lasts for three months following the repudiation (or any other type of divorce pronouncement) or, if the wife is pregnant, until the birth of the child.

The legal position of children within the family group with regard to guardianship, maintenance, and right of succession depends on their legitimacy. A child is legitimate if it can be reasonably assumed to have been conceived during the lawful wedlock of the parents. For a legal relationship to exist between a father and his illegitimate child, the father must publicly claim the child as his own, but there is always a legal tie between a mother and her illegitimate child. Guardianship of a child (the right to make decisions concerning, e.g., education and marriage) and of the property of minor children belongs to the father or another close male agnate relative. However, the right of custody (ḥaḍānah) of young children whose parents are divorced or separated belongs to the mother or another female maternal relative.

#### Law of succession

An individual’s power of testamentary disposition is basically limited to one-third of his or her net estate (i.e., the assets remaining after the payment of funeral expenses and debts). Two-thirds of the estate passes to the legal heirs of the deceased under the compulsory rules of inheritance.

There is a fundamental divergence between the Sunni and Shiʿi schemes of inheritance. Sunni law is essentially a system of inheritance by male agnate relatives, or ʿaṣabah—i.e., relatives who, if they are more than one degree removed from the deceased, trace their connection to the deceased through male links. Among the ʿaṣabah, priority is determined by:

1. class, with descendants excluding ascendants, who in turn exclude brothers and their issue, who in turn exclude uncles and their issue;
2. degree, with relatives nearer in degree to the deceased excluding the more remote within each class; and
3. strength of blood ties, with germane, or full-blood, connections excluding consanguine, or half-blood, connections among collateral relatives.

This agnatic system is mitigated by allowing surviving spouses and a limited number of females and nonagnates—daughters; sons’ daughters; mothers; grandmothers; germane, consanguine, and uterine sisters; and uterine brothers—to inherit a fixed fractional portion of the estate in certain circumstances. But the females among these relatives receive only half the share of the male relatives of the same class, degree, and blood tie, and no female excludes from inheritance any male agnate, however remote. No other female or nonagnatic relative has any right of inheritance in the presence of a male agnate. If, for example, the deceased is survived by his wife, his daughter’s son, and a distant agnatic cousin, the wife will be restricted to one-fourth of the inheritance, the grandson will be excluded altogether, and the cousin will inherit three-fourths of the estate.

Shiʿi law rejects the criterion of the agnatic tie and regards both maternal and paternal connections as equally strong grounds of inheritance. In the Shiʿi system, as in Sunni law, the surviving spouse always inherits a fixed portion, but all other relatives, including females and nonagnates, are divided into three classes:

1. parents and lineal descendants;
2. grandparents, brothers and sisters, and their issue; and
3. uncles and aunts and their issue.

Any relative of class 1 excludes any relative of class 2, who in turn excludes any relative of class 3. Within each class, the nearer in degree excludes the more remote, and the full-blood excludes the half-blood. While, therefore, a male relative normally takes double the share of the corresponding female relative, females and nonagnates are much more favourably treated in Shiʿi law than they are in Sunni law. In the case mentioned above, the wife would receive one-fourth, but the remaining three-fourths would go to the daughter’s son, or indeed to the daughter’s daughter, and not to the agnatic cousin.

Under Shiʿi law the only restriction upon testamentary power is the one-third rule, whereas Sunni law does not allow any bequest in favour of a legal heir. Under both systems, however, bequests that infringe these rules are not necessarily void and ineffective; when testators have acted beyond their powers, the bequests may still be ratified by the legal heirs. Further protection is afforded to the rights of the legal heirs by the doctrine of death sickness. Any gifts made by a dying person in contemplation of death are subject to precisely the same limitations as bequests and, if they exceed these limits, will be effective only with the consent of the legal heirs.

#### Procedure and evidence

Traditionally, sharia law was administered by the court of a single qadi, who was the judge of the facts as well as the law, although on difficult legal issues he might seek the advice of a professional jurist or jurisconsult (mufti). There was no hierarchy of courts and no organized system of appeals. Through his clerk (kātib), the qadi controlled court procedure, which was normally characterized by a lack of ceremony or sophistication. Legal representation was not unknown, but the parties would usually appear in person and address their pleas orally to the qadi.

The first task of the qadi was to decide which party bore the burden of proof. This was not necessarily the party who brought the suit; rather, it was the party whose contention was contrary to the initial legal presumption applying to the case. In the case of an alleged criminal offense, the relevant presumption was the innocence of the accused, and, in a suit for debt, the presumption was that the alleged debtor was free from debt. Hence, the burden of proof would rest upon the prosecution in the first case and upon the claiming creditor in the second. The burden of proof might of course shift between the parties several times during the same suit—for example, when an alleged debtor would plead a counterclaim against the creditor.

The standard of proof required—whether on an initial, intermediate, or final issue—was rigid and basically the same in both criminal and civil cases. In the absence of a confession or an admission by the defendant, the plaintiff or prosecutor was required to produce two witnesses to testify orally to their direct knowledge of the truth of his contention. Written evidence and circumstantial evidence, even of the most compelling kind, were normally inadmissible. Moreover, the oral testimony (shahādah) usually had to be given by two male adult Muslims of established integrity and character. In certain cases, however, the testimony of women was acceptable (two women being required in place of one man), and, in most claims of property, the plaintiff could satisfy the burden of proof through one witness and his own solemn oath as to the truth of his claim.

If the plaintiff or prosecutor produced the required degree of proof, judgment would be given in his favour. If he failed to produce any substantial evidence at all, judgment would be given in the defendant’s favour. If he produced some evidence but the evidence did not fulfill the strict requirements of shahādah, the defendant would be offered the oath of denial. Properly sworn, this oath would secure judgment in his favour; but if he refused it, judgment would be given in the plaintiff’s favour, provided, in some cases, that the latter himself would swear an oath.

In sum, the traditional system of procedure was largely self-operating. After his initial decision as to the incidence of the burden of proof, the qadi merely presided over the predetermined process of the law: witnesses were or were not produced; the oath was or was not administered and sworn; and the verdict followed automatically. This formalistic law of evidence was not, however, universally held. Dissenting jurists, such as the influential 14th-century Ḥanbalī scholar Ibn Taymiyyah, believed that any type of evidence, including circumstantial evidence and the testimony of any witness, was admissible to help the qadi reach the correct decision.

### Sharia law in contemporary Islam

#### Scope and mode of administration

During the 19th century the impact of Western civilization on Muslim society brought about radical changes in the fields of civil and commercial transactions and criminal law. In these areas, the sharia courts were felt to be wholly out of touch with the needs of the time, not only because of their system of procedure and evidence but also because of the substance of the sharia doctrine, which they were bound to apply. As a result, the criminal and general civil law of the sharia was abandoned in most Muslim countries and replaced by new codes, based on European models, with a new system of secular tribunals to apply them. Thus, with the notable exception of the Arabian Peninsula, where the sharia is still formally applied in its entirety, the application of sharia law in Islam has been broadly confined, from the beginning of the 20th century, to family law, including the law of succession at death and the particular institution of waqf endowments.

Nor, even within this circumscribed sphere, is sharia law today applied in the traditional manner. Throughout the Middle East, sharia family law is now generally expressed in the form of modern codes, and it is only in the absence of a specific relevant provision of the code that recourse is had to the traditionally authoritative legal manuals. In India and Pakistan, much of family law is today embodied in statutory legislation, and, since the law is there administered as a case-law system, the authority of judicial decisions has superseded that of the legal manuals.

In addition, in most Muslim countries, the court system has been reorganized to include, for instance, the provision of appellate jurisdictions. In Egypt and Tunisia, the sharia courts as a separate entity have been abolished, and sharia law is now administered through a unified system of national courts. In India and, since partition, in Pakistan, it has always been the case that sharia law has been applied by the same courts that apply the general civil and criminal law.

Finally, in many countries, special codes have been enacted to regulate the procedure and evidence of the courts that today apply sharia law. Across the Middle East, documentary and circumstantial evidence are now generally admissible; witnesses are put under oath and may be cross-examined; and the traditional pattern in which evidence is brought only by one side while the other side, in suitable circumstances, takes the oath of denial has largely broken down. In sum, the court has a much wider discretion in assessing the weight of the evidence than it had under the traditional system of evidence. In India and Pakistan the courts apply the same rules of evidence to cases of Islamic law as they do to civil cases generally. The system is basically English law, codified in the Indian Evidence Act of 1872.

#### Reform of sharia law

Traditional Islamic family law reflected to a large extent the patriarchal nature of Arabian tribal society in the early centuries of Islam. Not unnaturally, certain institutions and standards of that law have been deemed out of line with the circumstances of contemporary Muslim societies, particularly in urban areas, where tribal ties have disintegrated and movements for the emancipation of women have arisen. At first, this situation seemed to create the same apparent impasse between the changing circumstances of modern life and an allegedly immutable law that had caused the adoption of Western codes in civil and criminal matters. Hence, the only solution that seemed possible to Turkey in 1926 was the total abandonment of the sharia and the adoption of the Swiss Civil Code (chosen for its simplicity and modernity) in its place. No other Muslim country, however, has as yet followed this example. Instead, traditional sharia law has been adapted in a variety of ways to meet present social needs.

A central reformist concern in the Middle East has been the question of the juristic basis of reforms: granted their social desirability, reforms have had to be justified in terms of Islamic jurisprudential theory in order to frame them as a new, but nonetheless legitimate, version of the sharia. In the early stages of the reform movement, the doctrine of taqlīd (unquestioning acceptance) was still formally observed, and the juristic basis of reform lay in the doctrine of siyāsah, or “government,” which allows the political authority (who, of course, has no legislative power in the real sense of the term) to make administrative regulations of two principal types.

The first type concerns procedure and evidence and restricts the jurisdiction of the sharia courts in the sense that these courts are instructed not to hear cases that do not fulfill defined evidential requirements. Thus, according to an Egyptian law enacted in 1931, no disputed claim of marriage was to be entertained if the marriage could not be proved by an official certificate of registration, and no such certificate could be issued if the bride was younger than 16 or the bridegroom younger than 18 years of age at the time of the contract. Accordingly, the marriage of a minor contracted by the guardian was still perfectly valid but would not, if disputed, be the subject of judicial relief from the courts. In theory, the doctrine of the traditional authorities was not contradicted, but, in practice, the law represented an attempt to abolish the institution of child marriage.

The second type of administrative regulation was a directive to the courts as to which particular rule among existing variants they were to apply. This directive allowed the political authority to choose from the views of the different schools and jurists the opinion that it deemed best suited to present social circumstances. For example, the traditional Ḥanafī law in force in Egypt did not allow a wife to petition for divorce on the basis of any matrimonial offense committed by the husband, a situation that caused great hardship to abandoned or ill-treated wives. Mālikī law, however, recognized a wife’s right to judicial dissolution of her marriage for reasons such as the husband’s cruelty, failure to provide maintenance and support, or desertion. Accordingly, an Egyptian law of 1920 codified the Mālikī rule as the law henceforth to be applied by the sharia courts.

By way of comparison, in the Indian subcontinent, reform in the matters of child marriage and divorce was effected by statutory enactments that directly superseded the traditional Ḥanafī law. The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 prohibited the marriage of girls younger than 14 and boys younger than 16 under pain of penalties, while the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act of 1939, modelled on the English Matrimonial Causes Acts, allowed a Ḥanafī wife to obtain a judicial divorce on the standard grounds of cruelty, desertion, failure to maintain, or the like.

By the 1950s the potential for legal reform under the principle of siyāsah had been exhausted in the Middle East. Since that time, the basic doctrine of taqlīd has been challenged to an ever-increasing degree. On many points, the law recorded in the medieval manuals, insofar as it represents the early jurists’ interpretations of the Qurʾān and Hadith, has been deemed no longer to possess paramount and exclusive authority. Contemporary jurisprudence has claimed the right to renounce those interpretations and to interpret the original texts of divine revelation for itself, independently and afresh in the light of modern social circumstances—in short, to reopen the door of ijtihād that had, in theory, been closed since the 10th century.

The developing use of ijtihād as a means of legal reform may be seen through a comparison of the terms of the Syrian Law of Personal Status (1953) with those of the Tunisian Law of Personal Status (1957) in relation to the two subjects of polygamy and divorce by repudiation (ṭalāq).

As regards polygamy, the Syrian reformers argued that the Qurʾān itself urges a husband not to take additional wives unless he is financially able to make proper provision for the wives’ maintenance and support. Classical jurists had construed this verse as a moral exhortation binding only on the husband’s conscience, but the Syrian reformers maintained that it should be regarded as a positive legal condition precedent to the exercise of polygamy and enforced as such by the courts. This novel interpretation was then coupled with a normal administrative regulation that required the due registration of marriages after the permission of the court to marry had been obtained. The Syrian law accordingly states, “The qadi may withhold permission for a man who is already married to marry a second wife, when it is established that he is not in a position to support them both.”

Far more extreme was the approach of the Tunisian reformers. They argued that, in addition to a husband’s financial ability to support a plurality of wives, the Qurʾān required that co-wives be treated with complete impartiality. This Qurʾānic injunction too should be construed not simply as a moral exhortation but as a legal condition precedent to polygamy, in the sense that no second marriage should be permitted unless and until adequate evidence was forthcoming that the wives would in fact be treated impartially. However, under modern social and economic conditions, such impartial treatment was a practical impossibility. Since the essential conditions for polygamy could not be fulfilled, the Tunisian law succinctly declares: “Polygamy is prohibited.”

With regard to ṭalāq, the Syrian law provides that a wife who has been repudiated without just cause might be awarded by the court compensation from her former husband to the maximum extent of one year’s maintenance. The reform was once again represented as giving practical effect to certain Qurʾānic verses that had been generally regarded by traditional jurisprudence as moral rather than legally enforceable injunctions—namely, verses that enjoin husbands to “make a fair provision” for repudiated wives and to “retain wives with kindness or release them with consideration.” The effect of the Syrian law, then, is to subject the husband’s motive for repudiation to the scrutiny of the court and to penalize him, albeit to a limited extent, for abuse of his power.

Once again, the Tunisian ijtihād concerning repudiation is far more radical. The Tunisian reformers argued that the Qurʾān orders the appointment of arbitrators in the event of discord between husband and wife. A pronouncement of repudiation by a husband clearly indicates a state of discord between the spouses. Equally clearly, the official courts are best suited to undertake the function of arbitration that then becomes necessary according to the Qurʾān. It is on this broad ground that the Tunisian law abolishes the right of a husband to repudiate his wife extrajudicially: “Divorce outside a court of law is without legal effect.” Although the court must dissolve the marriage if the husband persists in his repudiation, it has unlimited power to grant the wife compensation for any damage she has sustained from the divorce—although in practice this power has been used most sparingly.

In Pakistan a new interpretation of the Qurʾān and Hadith was the declared basis of the reforms introduced by the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961, although the provisions of the ordinance in relation to polygamy and ṭalāq are much less radical than the corresponding Middle Eastern reforms, since a second marriage is simply made dependent on the consent of an Arbitration Council and the effect of a husband’s repudiation is merely suspended for a period of three months to afford opportunity for reconciliation.

Judicial decisions in Pakistan have also unequivocally endorsed the right of independent interpretation of the Qurʾān. For example, in Khurshīd Bībī v. Muḥammad Amīn (1967), the country’s Supreme Court held that a Muslim wife could as a right obtain a divorce simply by payment of suitable compensation to her husband. This decision was based on the court’s interpretation of a relevant Qurʾānic verse. However, under traditional sharia law, this form of divorce, known as khulʿ, in which a wife pays for her release, is a contract between the spouses and, as such, is entirely dependent upon the husband’s free consent.

These are just a few examples of the many far-reaching changes that have been effected in Islamic family law. But the whole process of legal reform as it has unfolded so far still involves great problems of principle and practice. A hard core of traditionalist opinion continues to reject adamantly the validity of reinterpretation of the basic texts of divine revelation. The traditionalists argue that the texts are being manipulated to yield the meaning that suits the preconceived purposes of the reformers; therefore, contrary to fundamental Islamic ideology, it is social desirability and not the will of God that is ultimately determining the law.

As regards the practical effects of legal reform, in many Muslim countries there is a deep social gulf between a Westernized and modernist minority and the conservative mass of the population. Reforms that aim at satisfying the standards of progressive urban society have little significance for the traditionalist communities of rural areas or for Muslim conservatives, whose geographical and social distribution crosses all apparent boundaries. It is also often the case that the qadis, given their background and training, are not wholly sympathetic to the purposes of the modernist legislators—an attitude often reflected in their interpretations of the new codes.

The one supreme achievement of Islamic jurisprudence over the past few decades has been the emergence of a functional approach to the role of law in society. Jurisprudence has discarded the introspective and idealistic attitude that the doctrine of taqlīd had imposed on it since medieval times and now sees its task to be the solution of the problems of contemporary society. It has emerged from a protracted period of stagnation to adopt again the attitude of the earliest Muslim jurists, whose aim was to relate the dictates of the divine will to their own social environment. It is this attitude alone that has ensured the survival of the sharia in modern times as a practical system of law and that provides inspiration for the future.
