## Continental law system

### The continental and civil law legal systems

The **Continental and Civil Law Legal Systems** can be truly considered to be the most prominent legal systems in the world which laid a foundation for legislation in many countries. Although, nowadays it can be quite difficult to find a distinguished boundary between Continental and Common Law Legal Systems (as they have adopted each other’s practices to a large extent), the legal scholars point out the list of criteria which might be employed to differentiate between those two legal systems. For instance, some scholars proposed “culture” or “language” to be used for classification. Others insisted that it must be ideology which stipulates peculiarities of Continental and Common Law Legal Systems. However, most of the scholars do agree that historical background and types of the sources used are the most objective criteria.

The Continental Law Legal System takes its origin in Roman Law in times when it was first codified by Roman emperor Justinian. Justinian’s efforts resulted in compilation called Corpus Juris Civilis. The fact that Corpus Juris Civilis was a main object for study in the Italian universities of Renaissance period enabled the Roman Law to spread over the rest of Europe and greatly influence European legal systems. The result of such influence was a continued tradition of codification during the age of enlightenment (in XVIII century) when separate national codes such as The French Napoleonic Code, German and Swiss codes were developed.

The Continental Law Legal System has been formed under the influence of legal scholars whose legal doctrines became a basis for codes. *Therefore, it is commonly accepted that civil law was developed in the universities rather than in courts.* In other words, the written rules such as legislative statutes have been the main source of law in civil law countries. It is precisely this fact that explains a diminished judge’s role in Continental Law Legal System. Since a civil judge has to apply already existing codes for resolving cases instead of expressing his judicial opinions there is much less importance attached to a civil judge’s merit in contrast to his common counterpart.

Common or English Legal System was first developed in England and Wales. It was later adopted by many countries throughout the world as a result of British colonisation. Australia, South East Asia, India and Hong Kong are the countries with “received” common tradition. The Common Law Legal System has been developed out of unwritten rules and customs. In common countries the cases are resolved by “judge-made decisions” which follow the principle of stare decisis, i.e. “to decide similar cases similarly”. This fact explains the importance of case law as a primary source of English Legal System.

> The principle of **stare decisis** is a fundamental doctrine in common law legal systems that obligates courts to follow the precedents set by previous judicial decisions when the same points arise again in litigation. The term "stare decisis" is Latin for "to stand by things decided." This principle ensures legal consistency, predictability, and stability by maintaining that similar cases are decided in similar ways.
>
> **Key Components of Stare Decisis:**
>
> 1. **Adherence to Precedent:**
>    - Courts are expected to follow the legal principles established in prior decisions, especially those from higher courts within the same jurisdiction.
>    - This adherence applies primarily to the *ratio decidendi*, the legal reasoning or principle upon which a case's decision is based.
>
> 2. **Hierarchy of Courts:**
>    - Lower courts are bound by the decisions of higher appellate courts.
>    - Decisions from courts of equal standing or from other jurisdictions may be considered persuasive but are not binding.
>
> 3. **Binding vs. Persuasive Precedent:**
>    - **Binding Precedent:** Must be followed. It comes from higher courts in the same jurisdiction.
>    - **Persuasive Precedent:** May influence a decision but is not obligatory. It can come from lower courts, courts of equal status, or courts in other jurisdictions.
>
> 4. **Exceptions and Overruling:**
>    - A court may depart from precedent if it deems the previous decision was wrong or societal conditions have changed.
>    - Higher courts have the authority to overrule decisions from lower courts or their own past decisions.
>
> **Advantages of Stare Decisis:**
>
> - **Legal Certainty:** Individuals and businesses can predict legal outcomes, which aids in planning and risk assessment.
> - **Equality and Fairness:** Similar cases are treated alike, promoting a sense of justice and impartiality.
> - **Efficiency:** Courts save time by relying on established legal principles rather than re-evaluating settled law in every case.
>
> **Limitations of Stare Decisis:**
>
> - **Rigidity:** Strict adherence may perpetuate outdated or unjust rulings.
> - **Judicial Discretion:** Judges may interpret precedents differently, leading to inconsistent applications.
> - **Evolving Societal Values:** Law may lag behind societal changes if courts are reluctant to overturn precedents.
>
> **Examples:**
>
> - **Brown v. Board of Education (1954, U.S.):** The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), showing that stare decisis allows for correction of past errors.
> - **Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932, UK):** Established the modern concept of negligence, setting a precedent for duty of care that courts have followed in subsequent cases.
>
> **Application in Legal Systems:**
>
> - **Common Law Jurisdictions:** Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia heavily rely on stare decisis.
> - **Civil Law Jurisdictions:** Less emphasis on precedent; courts focus more on statutory codes and less on judicial decisions.
>
> **Conclusion:**
>
> Stare decisis plays a crucial role in maintaining a coherent and stable legal system by ensuring that courts follow established legal principles. While it promotes consistency and reliability, the doctrine is flexible enough to allow the law to adapt over time through judicial review and the overruling of outdated precedents.

#### Procedural and substantive law

Procedural and Substantive Law are two branches of law which can not function independently from each other.

Substantive Law can be described as a body of rules which sets out the rights and obligations of members of society. On the other hand, Procedural Law encompasses legal rules to enforce and defend such rights and obligations. For instance, it is a substantive law that defines murder as a criminal offence. Meanwhile, the Procedural Law describes the way the arrests have to be made, witnesses are questioned and evidences are collected.

### Civil Law and Civil Procedure versus Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure

Civil Law is a form of private law and involves the relationships between individual citizens The Civil law attempts to resolve disagreements between individuals or organizations and to provide remedies. It should be emphasized that unlike criminal law, the civil law does not intend to punish the offender. Contract disputes, property disputes, divorce cases, child custody and other private matters are the issues regulated by Civil Law.

Criminal law is a branch of law which concerns crimes committed against the public authority. In contrast to Civil law where the remedy typically takes the form of compensation or fine, the offender in criminal proceeding can be punished by imprisonment, government supervision, loss of liberty, fine and even execution.

The civil and criminal procedures are different in terms of claimants bringing the case into court and parties involved in the trial process. Civil proceeding is initiated by the plaintiff represented either by an individual or an organization which strives to obtain a financial compensation for incurred damages. By contrast, any criminal proceeding is enforced by the state through the prosecutor. This happens because any crime against an individual is considered to be an offence to the society.

The prosecutor prepares evidences and charges against the accused criminal. Therefore, the burden of proof lies solely upon the prosecutor, which means that the prosecutor is responsible for providing evidences against the defendant. On the other side, the plaintiff is the only person to have the burden of proof in civil cases. Whereas *it is enough for plaintiff in civil procedure to persuade that the wrongdoing was likely to take place rather than not*, the prosecutor has an obligation to prove that the crime was committed *without any doubts*. In other words, the standard of proof in civil and criminal procedures is different: civil cases must be proven on the balance of probabilities and criminal cases – beyond a reasonable doubt.

In fact, the offence might be criminal and civil violation at the same time. For example, in case of car accident when there is an injured person, the driver is subject to criminal as well as civil procedure.

### Civil procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems

The significant differences in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems are stipulated mainly by the adherence either to the so-called “inquisitorial” or “adversarial” systems. Despite the fact that there have been a lot of borrowings recently in both systems, “inquisitorial” tradition is broadly defined as a prerogative of Continental Law trials, whereas Common Law trials follow “adversarial” system.

One of the factors which explain the substantial differences in civil procedures of Common and Continental Legal Systems is a judge’s role. In civil procedure governed by continental tradition the judge examines the evidences, questions the witnesses and prepares report, i.e. controls all aspects of the trial. Meanwhile, the role of judge in common civil procedure is that of a passive observer listening to the arguments and evidences presented both by a plaintiff and a defendant. Therefore, a Continental Law judge bears more responsibility for the trial rather than his Common Law counterpart.

Another point of divergence in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems is the stages of jurisdiction. In continental civil procedure these stages can be defined as preliminary stage, evidence-taking stage and decision making stage. As it can be noticed, the continental civil procedure never includes the trial stage which is sometimes a part of civil procedure in Common Legal System. This can be explained by the fact that in Common Legal System the trial is believed to be a final stage which necessarily includes a jury. Therefore, under such definition the trial does not exist in continental civil procedure. Instead of the trial the continental civil procedure consists of “a series of isolated meetings and written communications between counsel and the judge.”

The next important difference concerns an evidence-taking stage. As a matter of fact, the common lawyer is obliged to formulate the whole case at the very beginning which is an unusual practice for civil lawyers who prepares only some pieces of evidence for the first appearance before the court. Consequently, the degree of importance assigned to discovery process is much less in continental civil procedure rather than in common.

Although in continental civil procedure the judge is directly involved in the evidence-taking part of the proceeding, the case should be resolved by other judges. In contrast, the examination of evidences and the resolution of civil case are direct obligations of a single judge in common law tradition.

In continental civil law systems, while the judge is actively involved in the evidence-taking phase of the proceedings, the final resolution of the case is often entrusted to other judges who were not part of that initial phase. This separation is designed to enhance impartiality and fairness in the judicial process. Here's what it means:

> **Separation of Roles in the Judicial Process**
>
> 1. **Evidence-Taking Judge (Investigating Judge):**
>    - **Active Involvement in Evidence Gathering:** This judge conducts the investigation by collecting documents, interviewing witnesses, and overseeing the compilation of all relevant evidence.
>    - **Procedural Oversight:** They manage pre-trial procedures, address preliminary issues, and ensure that the evidence is gathered according to legal standards.
>    - **Neutral Facilitator:** Their role is to impartially collect all pertinent information without making judgments about the outcome.
>
> 2. **Deciding Judge(s):**
>    - **Reviewing the Collected Evidence:** The deciding judge or panel reviews the evidence compiled during the investigation phase.
>    - **Conducting the Trial:** They preside over the trial proceedings, hear legal arguments from both parties, and may allow for additional evidence or witness testimonies if necessary.
>    - **Rendering Judgment:** Based on the reviewed evidence and applicable law, they make a final decision on the case.
>
> **Reasons for the Separation**
>
> - **Impartiality and Objectivity:**
>   - **Avoiding Bias:** Judges who have been involved in gathering evidence might develop preconceived notions about the case. By having different judges decide the case, the system aims to prevent any potential bias.
>   - **Fresh Evaluation:** Deciding judges approach the case without prior involvement, allowing for an unbiased assessment of the evidence and arguments.
>
> - **Specialization of Judicial Functions:**
>   - **Efficiency:** Judges can specialize in procedural management or adjudication, enhancing the efficiency and expertise in each phase.
>   - **Complex Cases Management:** In cases with extensive or complex evidence, specialized judges can more effectively handle the intricacies of evidence collection.
>
> **Examples in Civil Law Systems**
>
> 1. **France:**
>    - **Juge de la Mise en État (Pre-Trial Judge):**
>      - Handles pre-trial matters, including evidence gathering and procedural issues.
>      - Does not participate in the final decision unless the case is straightforward and the parties agree.
>    - **Trial Judges:**
>      - A different judge or panel conducts the trial and renders the judgment based on the compiled evidence.
>
> 2. **Germany:**
>    - **Single Judge Proceedings:**
>      - In lower courts, a single judge may handle all aspects, but in higher courts or complex cases, roles may be divided.
>    - **Chambers with Multiple Judges:**
>      - A rapporteur judge may be responsible for preparing the case, but the final decision is made collectively by the chamber judges.
>
> 3. **Italy:**
>    - **Giudice Istruttore (Instructing Judge):**
>      - Oversees the preparatory phase, manages evidence collection, and addresses procedural matters.
>    - **Deciding Judge(s):**
>      - Another judge or panel takes over for the trial phase to decide the case based on the instruction judge's dossier.
>
> **Implications for the Judicial Process**
>
> - **Enhanced Fairness:**
>   - **Defendant's Rights Protection:** Ensures that the defendant receives a fair trial by judges who have not formed opinions during the evidence collection.
>   - **Balanced Evaluation:** Both parties can present their arguments to judges who assess the case solely on the merits presented during the trial.
>
> - **Procedural Safeguards:**
>   - **Transparency:** Clear separation of duties makes the process more transparent and understandable for the parties involved.
>   - **Checks and Balances:** The system provides internal checks by having multiple judges involved at different stages.
>
> **Contrast with Common Law Systems**
>
> - **Unified Judicial Role:**
>   - In common law jurisdictions, the same judge (or jury) typically oversees the entire process, from evidence presentation to final judgment.
>   - **Adversarial Nature:** The parties are responsible for presenting evidence, and the judge acts as an impartial referee rather than an active investigator.
>
> **Benefits of the Separation**
>
> - **Objective Decision-Making:**
>   - Judges deciding the case do so without any prior involvement, ensuring decisions are based solely on the evidence and arguments presented during the trial phase.
>
> - **Efficiency and Expertise:**
>   - Allows for procedural efficiency by assigning evidence collection to judges specialized in that area.
>   - Deciding judges can focus on legal analysis and application of the law without the procedural burdens of evidence gathering.
>
> **Potential Challenges**
>
> - **Communication Gaps:**
>   - Ensuring that the deciding judges fully understand the context and nuances of the evidence collected by another judge may require careful management.
>
> - **Extended Timelines:**
>   - Transferring cases between judges can introduce additional steps, potentially affecting the speed of proceedings.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> In continental civil law systems, the practice of having judges other than those involved in evidence-taking resolve the case is a structural approach to uphold judicial impartiality and fairness. By separating the investigative and adjudicative functions, the system seeks to prevent biases that could arise from a judge's involvement in evidence gathering. This ensures that the final decision is made by judges who evaluate the case objectively, based on the evidence and legal arguments presented during the trial phase. This method reflects the civil law tradition's emphasis on a fair and just legal process, balancing thorough investigation with impartial adjudication.

The continental and common civil procedure uses written and oral arguments respectively. For example, during the witness testimony in common civil procedure the questions are asked orally by the advocates of both parties, whereas it is compulsory for the continental advocate to propose a question in written form to judge who can either accept or reject it. This example illustrates not only the difference in common and continental civil procedure in terms of oral or written arguments but also in the presence of cross-examination. In other words, cross-examination does not take place in continental civil procedure.

Civil procedures in Common and Continental Legal Systems differ in terms of parties who incur counsel fees. In the former case, except for England, counsel fees must be paid by each party regardless of the case’s outcome. On the other hand, in civil law countries, the loser covers the winner’s counsel fees.

A civil case trial in a civil law system is distinct from that in common law jurisdictions due to differences in legal traditions and procedural approaches. Civil law systems are prevalent in continental Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, and Asia. They are based on codified statutes and legal codes rather than case law precedents.

> Here is an overview of how a civil case trial typically unfolds in a civil law system:
>
> 1. **Initiation of the Lawsuit:**
>    - **Filing the Complaint:** The plaintiff submits a written complaint to the court, outlining the facts and legal basis for the claim.
>    - **Service of Process:** The court serves the complaint to the defendant, who is then required to respond within a specified time frame.
>
> 2. **Written Pleadings:**
>    - **Exchange of Documents:** Both parties exchange written submissions, including the complaint, defense, counterclaims, and replies.
>    - **Emphasis on Documentation:** The initial stages focus heavily on written evidence and legal arguments submitted to the court.
>
> 3. **Role of the Judge:**
>    - **Active Judicial Role:** The judge plays an inquisitorial role, actively managing the proceedings and investigating the facts.
>    - **Case Management:** The judge identifies the legal and factual issues, orders the production of evidence, and may even question witnesses directly.
>    - **Neutral Fact-Finder:** Unlike in common law systems, the judge seeks to uncover the truth rather than merely adjudicate between opposing parties.
>
> 4. **Evidence Gathering:**
>    - **Limited Discovery Process:** Pre-trial discovery is less extensive, with the court controlling the evidence-gathering process.
>    - **Court-Appointed Experts:** Experts may be appointed by the court to provide impartial opinions on technical matters.
>    - **Written Evidence:** There is a greater reliance on documents and written expert reports over oral testimony.
>
> 5. **Hearings and Oral Proceedings:**
>    - **Structured Hearings:** Hearings are often more formal and shorter, focusing on clarifying points from the written submissions.
>    - **Judge-Led Questioning:** The judge conducts the questioning of parties and witnesses, with limited cross-examination by lawyers.
>    - **Minimal Witness Testimony:** Oral testimonies are less emphasized, and witness statements may be submitted in writing.
>
> 6. **Legal Representation:**
>    - **Advisory Role of Lawyers:** Attorneys assist in preparing written submissions and may present legal arguments but have a less adversarial role during hearings.
>    - **Collaboration Over Confrontation:** The process encourages cooperation to establish the facts rather than adversarial contention.
>
> 7. **Decision and Judgment:**
>    - **Written Judgment:** The judge issues a detailed written decision, explaining the legal reasoning and application of the law.
>    - **No Jury System:** Civil cases are decided by judges without the involvement of a jury.
>
> 8. **Appeals Process:**
>    - **Right to Appeal:** Parties can appeal the decision to a higher court, which may review both factual and legal aspects.
>    - **De Novo Review:** Appellate courts may re-examine the case entirely, not just the legal interpretations.
>
> 9. **Costs and Fees:**
>    - **Loser Pays Principle:** The losing party is often required to pay the legal costs of the winning party, including court fees and attorney fees.
>
> **Key Characteristics of Civil Law Trials:**
>
> - **Codified Laws:** Legal codes provide a comprehensive set of rules that judges apply to cases.
> - **Inquisitorial System:** The judge actively investigates the facts, reducing the burden on the parties to present evidence.
> - **Reduced Precedent Reliance:** Past judicial decisions have persuasive value but are not binding precedents as in common law systems.
> - **Efficiency and Predictability:** The structured process aims for a swift resolution, with clear procedural rules reducing uncertainty.
>
> **Examples by Country:**
>
> - **France:** The French civil procedure emphasizes written submissions, with judges playing a central role in gathering and assessing evidence.
> - **Germany:** German courts focus on written documents and have a procedural code that guides the judge's active involvement.
> - **Japan:** While influenced by both civil and common law traditions, Japan's civil procedure aligns more with the civil law model, emphasizing judge-led proceedings.
>
> **Conclusion:**
>
> A civil case trial in a civil law system is characterized by an active judicial role, a focus on written evidence, and a less adversarial atmosphere. The judge directs the proceedings to uncover the truth, applying codified laws to reach a decision. This approach aims to enhance efficiency, reduce litigation costs, and provide a predictable legal environment.

### Criminal procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems

A lot of differences in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems discussed above can be applied to criminal procedure as well. The explanation beyond this is what tradition, adversarial or inquisitorial, the Legal System follows. For example, the role of impartial referee assigned to the judge in common civil procedure is the same for judge in common criminal procedure. Alternatively, in both continental civil and criminal cases the judge acts as an inquisitor. Moreover, the witness testimony in criminal procedure of both legal systems follows the same pattern as in civil procedure. However, there are some distinctive differences which uniquely determine criminal procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems.

First of all, the criminal case in Common Legal System is initiated by the wronged person, his relatives or any other member of the society. A presiding officer is appointed then to hear and decide the case. By contrast, the private accuser in continental criminal procedure is replaced by public official, who represents the State’s interests. In other words, the contest has shifted from two individuals to an individual and the State.

Secondly, the difference can be found in examining phase of criminal proceeding. At this stage the evidences are collected followed by compilation of the dossier. While it is allowed to disclose the dossier to the defense in continental criminal proceeding it is prohibited in common legal proceeding.

Thirdly, in common criminal procedure the defendant must be sworn and can not refuse to answer while being questioned. On the contrary, this practice is not applied to criminal justice system in continental countries where the case is exactly the opposite.

Another important difference in criminal procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems is plea bargaining. In contrast to common criminal procedure where plea bargaining is a distinctive feature, the prosecutor power is limited in continental countries. Moreover, in common countries “the defendant who pleads guilty forgoes a trial”. In civil countries, however, the plea guilty is not a hard evidence for defendant’s guilt. Therefore, the trial necessary takes place.

Finally, it is wrongly believed that there are no concepts of jury trial and presumption of innocence in civil criminal proceedings. In fact, “a legal presumption of innocence does exist in many civil law jurisdictions”, although in some civil countries it may not exist as a formal rule of law. Similarly, the jury trial is replaced with lay advisers. However, the verdict of lay advisers is not always a conclusive ruling for the defendant to be accused or acquitted.

> **==Lay Advisers== in Criminal Cases in Civil Law Systems**
>
> In criminal cases within civil law systems, **lay advisers**—also known as **lay judges** or **lay assessors**—are non-professional individuals who participate in the judicial process alongside professional judges. They serve a role similar to jurors in common law systems but function differently within the court proceedings.
>
> **Understanding the Role of Lay Advisers**
>
> 1. **Replacement of Jury Trials:**
>    - **No Traditional Jury:** Many civil law countries do not use juries composed solely of laypeople to determine a defendant's guilt or innocence.
>    - **Lay Judges Instead of Juries:** Instead, they incorporate lay advisers into the judicial panel, integrating citizens directly into the decision-making process.
>
> 2. **Participation in the Judicial Panel:**
>    - **Collaborative Decision-Making:** Lay advisers sit with professional judges during trials, hear all the evidence, and participate in deliberations.
>    - **Voting Rights:** They have the right to vote on the verdict and, in some cases, on sentencing decisions.
>    - **Community Representation:** Their involvement brings societal perspectives and values into the courtroom, promoting transparency and public trust in the judicial system.
>
> 3. **Non-Conclusive Verdicts:**
>    - **Collective Verdicts:** Decisions are made collectively by the panel of judges, which includes both lay and professional members.
>    - **Influence of Professional Judges:** While lay advisers contribute to the verdict, professional judges often have significant influence due to their legal expertise.
>    - **No Sole Authority:** The verdict is not solely determined by the lay advisers; it results from the combined judgment of all panel members.
>
> 4. **Presumption of Innocence:**
>    - **Fundamental Principle:** The presumption of innocence exists in many civil law jurisdictions, ensuring that defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty.
>    - **Legal Implementation:** Even if not explicitly codified, this principle is upheld through judicial practices and procedural safeguards.
>
> **Examples in Civil Law Countries**
>
> 1. **Germany:**
>    - **Schöffen (Lay Judges):**
>      - In certain criminal cases, two lay judges join one or more professional judges.
>      - **Equal Voting Rights:** Lay judges have equal say in verdicts and sentencing.
>      - **Deliberation Process:** Decisions require a majority; professional judges do not have overriding authority but may influence deliberations through legal reasoning.
>
> 2. **France:**
>    - **Cour d'Assises (Criminal Court for Serious Offenses):**
>      - Consists of three professional judges and six or nine lay jurors (depending on the severity of the case).
>      - **Verdict Requirements:**
>        - A supermajority (e.g., 8 out of 12 votes) may be required for conviction in serious cases.
>      - **Joint Deliberation:** Professional judges and lay jurors deliberate together, blending legal expertise with public opinion.
>
> 3. **Japan:**
>    - **Saiban-in System (Lay Judge System):**
>      - In serious criminal cases, six lay judges work alongside three professional judges.
>      - **Decision-Making:**
>        - Verdicts and sentences are determined by majority vote, which must include at least one professional judge.
>      - **Purpose:** Aims to increase public participation and confidence in the legal system.
>
> **Key Points to Understand**
>
> - **Integration of Lay Participation:**
>   - Civil law systems incorporate lay advisers to involve ordinary citizens directly in the judicial process, differing from the separate jury system in common law countries.
>
> - **Collective Decision-Making:**
>   - Verdicts are the result of collaborative deliberation between lay advisers and professional judges, combining legal knowledge with societal perspectives.
>
> - **Role in Ensuring Fairness:**
>   - The inclusion of lay advisers helps ensure that legal decisions are grounded in community values and that the judicial process remains transparent and accountable.
>
> - **Presumption of Innocence:**
>   - Despite misconceptions, civil law systems generally uphold the presumption of innocence, providing defendants with fundamental protections throughout the trial.
>
> **Understanding the Misconception**
>
> - **No Juries Doesn't Mean No Public Participation:**
>   - The absence of a traditional jury trial does not imply that civil law systems lack public involvement; they simply integrate laypersons differently.
>
> - **Verdict Influence:**
>   - While lay advisers contribute significantly, the final verdict is a collective decision, preventing any single group from having undue influence over the outcome.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> In criminal cases within civil law systems, lay advisers serve as an integral part of the judicial panel, working alongside professional judges to decide cases. They replace the traditional jury found in common law systems, providing a means for public participation and helping to ground legal decisions in community values. While they share in the decision-making process, their verdicts are part of a collective outcome and not solely determinative. This system upholds principles like the presumption of innocence and seeks to balance legal expertise with societal input, ensuring fair and transparent judicial proceedings.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I would like to say that as our world tends to move toward globalization the borders between Continental and Common Law Legal systems, and as a result, between procedures of those systems become feebly marked. As an example, Continental Legal System has started to rely more on previous cases whereas a lot of importance is attached to statutes in modern common law countries. Base themselves upon that fact, a lot of legal scholars speak out in support of convergence theory which suggests a creation of single legislation for all countries throughout the world. Will this theory ever become a reality? Time will show. However, to my point of view, before it becomes possible we have to reach the convergence of cultures, ideologies, moral values and political attitudes.
