## Different applications of civil law

The application of civil law is a global and large one; in fact, we have some classifications that are made from a geographical perspective.

### Area of Napoleon system

The Napoleonic legal system was born in western Europe and linked with the development and principles of the French Revolution (principles of unity and general equality).

Napoleon, the son of the revolution, stopped the revolution and created the consulate in 1799, 10 years after the beginning of the French Revolution, which marked the end of the old regime. And the legal system of the First Empire followed the revolution.

> The characterization of Napoleon Bonaparte as the "son of the French Revolution" reflects the significant impact that the French Revolution had on his rise to power and the transformation of France into a modern nation-state. There are several reasons why Napoleon is often associated with the French Revolution:
>
> 1. **Rise to Power**: Napoleon emerged as a prominent military leader during the tumultuous period of the French Revolution. His military successes, particularly during the French Revolutionary Wars, propelled him to prominence within the French government and eventually led to his rise to power as First Consul and later Emperor of the French.
>
> 2. **Continuation of Revolutionary Ideals**: Despite consolidating power and establishing himself as a dictator, Napoleon claimed to be a defender of the revolutionary principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. He implemented legal and administrative reforms that aimed to modernize France and promote social mobility, including the Napoleonic Code, which codified many of the revolutionary legal principles.
>
> 3. **Expansion of Revolutionary Ideals**: Napoleon's conquests across Europe spread revolutionary ideals and institutions, such as the abolition of feudal privileges, the establishment of legal equality, and the secularization of state institutions. His military campaigns aimed to export the principles of the French Revolution to other countries, often by force.
>
> 4. **Centralization of Power**: Napoleon centralized power in France, establishing a strong, centralized state apparatus that was characteristic of the revolutionary era. He implemented administrative reforms, created a merit-based system for government appointments, and centralized control over the military, finances, and legal system.
>
> 5. **Legacy of Revolutionary Wars**: The wars of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars reshaped the political landscape of Europe and contributed to the spread of nationalist sentiment. Napoleon's military campaigns and the upheaval they caused had a profound impact on European politics and society for decades to come.
>
> While Napoleon's rule represented a departure from the democratic aspirations of the early French Revolution, his reign marked a continuation and transformation of the revolutionary legacy. As such, he is often viewed as both a product of the French Revolution and a figure who shaped its legacy in significant ways.

#### The French Revolution and principle of equality

During the old regime, different people had different legal status according to the league they belonged to, their social status (noble or civilian), or their religion. Different territories had different legal systems at that time. For example, Lyon did not have exactly the same law as Grenoble in the old regime; different provinces have different laws.

During the old regime, Jews and Protestants didn't have the same rights as Catholics, which in fact was the state religion. According to the civil law, Jews and Protestants weren’t supposed to exist in the legal system. For example, their marriage would not be recognized if the wedding was not held in a Catholic church, as would their children. As a consequence, their children didn't have inheritance rights.

The legal system was also unfair for foreigners, according to which foreigners like Arabs had to pay additional fees to buy properties.

In 1789, the French Revolution ended this. The *Declaration of Rights* outlines the rights of all men. When Napoleon came into power in 1799, he wanted a unity of law for all people in the whole territory. In the Napoleonic civil code, foreigners have the same rights to sell, buy, and own properties as French citizens. However, there were still dictatorships, meaning that there was no freedom of press and speech, no political freedom, and oppositions were repressed.

> The Napoleonic Code, officially known as the Civil Code of the French Republic (Code civil des Français), was drafted under the leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte's government in France. The drafting process began shortly after Napoleon came to power following the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire in November 1799.
>
> The Napoleonic Code was primarily the work of a commission of legal experts and scholars led by Jean-Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, who was the Second Consul of France and a close associate of Napoleon. The commission was tasked with creating a comprehensive legal code that would unify and modernize the French legal system, replacing the patchwork of laws and customs that existed under the Ancien Régime and the revolutionary period.
>
> The drafting process took several years, with the Napoleonic Code being formally adopted and promulgated on March 21, 1804. This marked the completion of the code and its official entry into force. The Napoleonic Code represented a significant milestone in the history of French law and had a profound impact on legal systems around the world, influencing civil law jurisdictions and serving as a model for subsequent legal codes.

#### The Second Empire in the 19th century

The First Empire is the one after the French Revolution, and the second one was during the 19th century (1852–1871). Napoleon first abdicated and gave his power to his son (Napoleon II), who never reigned and left France to study in Austria. Napoleon III came into power and built the Second Empire, which was more liberal than the first one. At the end of the Second Empire, France was more or less a democratic country.

The industrial revolution happened during the Second Empire, and the economic landscape became different. All systems of trading that are existing today come from the Second Empire. There was the 1867 trade law, which is the foundation of the trade law nowadays. Different types of contracts are also developed.

> The 1867 trade law in France, also known as the "Loi sur la liberté du commerce et de l'industrie" (Law on the Freedom of Trade and Industry), was a significant piece of legislation enacted during the Second Empire under the rule of Emperor Napoleon III. This law aimed to modernize and liberalize France's economic policies, particularly in the areas of trade and industry.
>
> Key provisions of the 1867 trade law included:
>
> 1. **Reduction of Trade Barriers**: The law sought to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers that hindered the free movement of goods within France and with other countries. By promoting free trade, the law aimed to stimulate economic growth, encourage competition, and increase efficiency in the marketplace.
>
> 2. **Protection of Intellectual Property**: The law introduced measures to protect intellectual property rights, including patents and trademarks. This helped to incentivize innovation and creativity by ensuring that inventors and creators could benefit from their work and investments.
>
> 3. **Promotion of Industrialization**: The law included provisions to support industrial development and modernization in France. This included measures to encourage investment in manufacturing, infrastructure, and technology, as well as the establishment of industrial zones and trade fairs to showcase French products.
>
> 4. **Regulation of Labor Relations**: The law addressed labor relations and working conditions in French industries. While it did not provide comprehensive labor protections, it introduced some regulations aimed at improving conditions for workers, such as limitations on working hours and child labor.
>
> 5. **Encouragement of Entrepreneurship**: The law aimed to promote entrepreneurship and small business development by reducing bureaucratic barriers to starting and operating businesses. This included simplifying administrative procedures and providing support for entrepreneurs and startups.
>
> Overall, the 1867 trade law in France represented a significant step towards modernizing and liberalizing the country's economy during the Second Empire. It reflected the broader economic policies of Napoleon III's regime, which sought to balance the interests of industry, commerce, and labor while promoting economic growth and national prosperity.

The system of cooperation (Société anonyme) developed.

> "==Société anonyme==" is a French term that translates to "anonymous society" in English. In legal terms, it refers to a type of business entity or corporation characterized by the following features:
>
> 1. **Limited Liability**: Shareholders of a société anonyme have limited liability, meaning their personal assets are generally protected from the debts and liabilities of the company. In the event of bankruptcy or legal claims against the company, shareholders are typically only liable for the amount of their investment in the company.
>
> 2. **Separate Legal Personality**: Like other forms of corporations, a société anonyme has a separate legal personality distinct from its shareholders. This means the company can own property, enter into contracts, and sue or be sued in its own name.
>
> 3. **Ownership by Shareholders**: The ownership of a société anonyme is represented by shares, which are owned by shareholders. Shareholders elect a board of directors to oversee the management of the company on their behalf.
>
> 4. **Public or Private**: A société anonyme can be either publicly traded or privately held. Publicly traded companies are listed on a stock exchange and their shares are available for purchase by the public. Private companies, on the other hand, have a limited number of shareholders and their shares are not traded on a public market.
>
> 5. **Regulated by Law**: The formation and operation of a société anonyme are governed by legal regulations specific to the jurisdiction in which it is established. These regulations typically address matters such as corporate governance, shareholder rights, financial reporting, and disclosure requirements.
>
> Overall, a société anonyme is a commonly used legal structure for businesses in France and other jurisdictions, offering advantages such as limited liability for shareholders and flexibility in ownership and management. It is often used for medium to large-sized companies with multiple shareholders and complex business operations.

The main codex in France, which had been voted during the First Empire, the civil code, criminal code, and trade code, had been conserved during the regimes because it was efficient and good.

#### The spread of the Napoleonic legal system

The legal system in France had also been applied in other European countries during the First Empire. At that time, a large part of Europe was incorporated into the French Empire, and there were 140 departments in the French Empire (nowadays, there are only 100 departments in the republic). In fact, the French Empire conquered many territories during the industrial revolution, including Genève in Switzerland and Belgium. There were applications of French laws, codes, and institutions (préfet) at the end of the 19^th^ century in these territories.

France and other countries were greatly impacted by the Roman Empire. The finding of Pompeii's ruins indicates that the Roman Empire had a significant influence on French art and furnishings. In the Roman era, the senate (sénat) in the Roman assembly had strong and fair power. The similar institution was adopted by multiple countries, and sénats were established. French territories shared all of the same institutions and organizations as France When they were a part of the French Empire.

> Italy was part of the French Empire under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte during the Napoleonic era. Napoleon's military campaigns and conquests in Italy led to significant changes in the political landscape of the Italian peninsula.
>
> During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon conquered and annexed several regions of Italy, including the Kingdom of Italy, which he established in 1805. The Kingdom of Italy was initially a puppet state controlled by Napoleon, with himself as its king. The capital of the Kingdom of Italy was established in Milan.
>
> Napoleon's control over Italy extended beyond the Kingdom of Italy. He also exerted influence over other Italian states and territories, either directly through annexation or indirectly through alliances and client states. For example, the Kingdom of Naples and the Papal States were among the regions that came under French control or influence during Napoleon's rule.
>
> Napoleon's reforms in Italy aimed to centralize administration, modernize governance, and implement legal and social reforms based on the principles of the French Revolution. These reforms included the introduction of the Napoleonic legal code, the abolition of feudal privileges, the establishment of new administrative divisions, and the promotion of economic development and infrastructure projects.
>
> Overall, Italy was a significant part of the French Empire during the Napoleonic era, with Napoleon exerting considerable influence over the region through conquest, annexation, and political alliances. His rule had a lasting impact on Italy's political, social, and cultural development during this period.

The result of the Congress of Vienna was that France would remain what it was before the Revolution. However, the new succeeding authorities decided to keep the French codes and institutions because this system was considered very modern and efficient. Nowadays, if you compare the main principles of Italy, the Netherlands, southern Germany, etc., the philosophy is the same. The influences of Roman law were also kept.

> The Congress of Vienna was a major international conference held in Vienna, Austria, from September 1814 to June 1815. It was convened to reorganize Europe in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars and to restore stability and order to the continent after decades of upheaval.
>
>Key objectives of the Congress of Vienna included:
>
> 1. **Redrawing the Map of Europe**: The Congress aimed to redraw the boundaries of European states that had been altered by Napoleon's conquests and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. The goal was to establish a new balance of power among the European nations to prevent future conflicts.
>
> 2. **Restoring Legitimate Monarchies**: The Congress sought to restore legitimate monarchies and dynasties that had been displaced or overthrown during the Napoleonic era. This involved reinstating ruling families to their thrones and suppressing revolutionary movements and nationalist uprisings.
>
> 3. **Maintaining Stability and Order**: The Congress aimed to establish mechanisms for maintaining stability and order in Europe, including collective security arrangements and diplomatic protocols. This included the establishment of the Concert of Europe, a system of regular diplomatic meetings among the major European powers to address common concerns and prevent conflicts.
>
> 4. **Conservative Diplomacy**: The Congress of Vienna was characterized by conservative diplomacy, with a focus on restoring traditional institutions, values, and social hierarchies. This approach reflected the prevailing sentiment among European leaders who sought to roll back the revolutionary changes brought about by the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars.
>
> The Congress of Vienna was attended by representatives from most of the major European powers, including Austria, Britain, France, Prussia, and Russia. The negotiations were led by prominent diplomats and statesmen, such as Klemens von Metternich of Austria, Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh of Britain, and Prince Talleyrand of France.
>
> The decisions made at the Congress of Vienna had a profound impact on the political map of Europe and shaped the continent's geopolitical landscape for decades to come. While the Congress succeeded in restoring stability to Europe in the short term, it also laid the groundwork for future tensions and conflicts, particularly as nationalist aspirations and rivalries continued to simmer beneath the surface.

France had multiple colonial empires where the French law system applied, including many Muslim countries. There was the "**domestic principle**." In the colonies, the Muslim population was ruled by Muslim law, while the French legal system applied to the French population and foreigners coming from other areas.

> The "==domestic principle== (principe de l'indigénat in French)" in the context of the French colonial legal system refers to a legal doctrine that governed the administration of justice within French colonies. This principle dictated that the laws and legal institutions of France applied within the colonial territories, effectively extending French law to overseas territories.
>
> From a legal perspective, the domestic principle had several key implications:
>
> 1. **Application of French Law**: Under the domestic principle, French colonial authorities applied French law within the colonies, including both statutory law enacted by the French government and customary law derived from French legal traditions. This meant that French legal norms, procedures, and principles governed various aspects of colonial life, such as civil rights, property rights, criminal justice, and commercial transactions.
>
> 2. **Uniformity and Centralization**: The domestic principle aimed to promote uniformity and centralization in the administration of justice across the French empire. By applying French law in the colonies, colonial administrators sought to ensure consistency in legal practices and outcomes, as well as to reinforce the authority of the French state over colonial subjects and territories.
>
> 3. **Extension of French Legal Institutions**: In addition to applying French law, the domestic principle also involved the extension of French legal institutions, such as courts, administrative bodies, and legal professionals, to the colonies. French colonial authorities established courts and tribunals in the colonies that operated according to French legal procedures and jurisprudence, with judges appointed by the French government.
>
> 4. **Assimilation and Integration**: The domestic principle reflected the colonial policy of assimilation, which aimed to integrate colonial subjects into French society and culture by imposing French legal norms and institutions upon them. Through the application of French law, colonial administrators sought to impose French values, customs, and standards of behavior on indigenous populations, often at the expense of local legal traditions and practices.
>
> 5. **Colonial Resistance and Adaptation**: While the domestic principle provided a legal framework for colonial rule, it also faced resistance and adaptation from colonial subjects who sought to assert their own legal traditions, identities, and rights. Indigenous peoples often challenged the imposition of French law and institutions, leading to conflicts, negotiations, and accommodations between colonial authorities and local communities.
>
> Overall, the domestic principle played a central role in shaping the legal framework of French colonialism, emphasizing the extension of French law and institutions to overseas territories as a means of asserting colonial control and promoting assimilation. However, it also generated tensions and complexities as colonial subjects negotiated their legal identities and rights within the context of colonial rule.

In the French legal system, there is the notion of “**service publique**," which means service that is ruled by the administration with the purpose of social welfare, such as public universities, public hospitals, etc. The idea is that they are organized and ruled by the government, not like money-making classical trade but for the purpose of social welfare.

In some colonies, the Muslims are ruled by Muslim law in the private domain, including marriage, inheritance, some taxes, contracts, etc. While in the public domain, such as public service and administration, French laws were applied, making the institution more western.

The general application of French law: in French territories such as Madagascar (l'île de la réunion), when the French troops arrived, there were no inhabitants in the territory; in this case, all the population were ruled by the general French law.

The justice systems in French colonies are also inspired by the French legal system. There were French justice systems for the application of French law, but Muslin justice instructions also existed for the Muslin law. For example, in Algeria, where the majority are Muslims, before its independence, we had the national justice system inspired by the French system and local Muslim tribunals that existed mainly for family law. The **Wilayas** (provinces) in Algeria look like French departments, where there is a prefecture and the administrative code is applied with the principles of service publique.

After Algeria became independent, a huge part of the French legal system was kept. Nowadays, the main difference between the Algerian legal system and the French legal system is the family law, since the family law in Algeria is inspired by Islamic law, but they are quite close in other domains. The link between the two legal systems still exists, and the influence continues. There are many cooperations between France and its formal colonies; people come from formal colonies to France for internships and studies.

There are other countries whose legal systems are inspired by the French legal system, not because of colonization but because they think the French legal system is good. For example, the Malta island, which is a former British colony, had many lawyers study in France and Italy. Therefore, Malta is influenced by the civil law system rather than the British common law system. There are some South-American countries, like Chile, whose legal systems are also influenced by the French legal system.

#### Concept of public service

During the 1950s and 1960s, the French legal system was very well recognized in many other countries whose lawyers studied the French legal system. These countries established French-style public administrations inspired by French conceptions of public service.

In the 1970s, the School of New Public Administration developed in the US, where there was rapid growth in the public service due to extensive suburbanization and urbanization. This theory, which also emphasizes the importance of results and benefits, has nowadays become the main theory of public administration and has substituted for the French theory in many foreign countries.

> ==New Public Administration== (NPA) is a term that refers to a movement within the field of public administration that emerged in the United States during the late 20th century. NPA represents a shift away from traditional bureaucratic models of public administration towards a more humanistic, democratic, and participatory approach to governance.
>
> Key features of New Public Administration include:
>
> 1. **Emphasis on Public Service Values**: NPA advocates for a focus on public service values such as accountability, transparency, equity, and social justice. It emphasizes the importance of public administrators serving the public interest and addressing the needs of all citizens, particularly marginalized and underserved populations.
>
> 2. **Democratic Governance**: NPA promotes democratic principles and practices within public administration, including citizen participation, deliberative decision-making processes, and collaboration between government agencies, civil society organizations, and citizens. It seeks to enhance the democratic legitimacy and responsiveness of public institutions.
>
> 3. **Management Reform**: NPA calls for reforms in the management and organization of public agencies to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and responsiveness. This includes adopting management techniques from the private sector, such as performance measurement, strategic planning, and outcome-based evaluation, while also recognizing the unique challenges and responsibilities of public service delivery.
>
> 4. **Social Equity and Inclusion**: NPA places a strong emphasis on promoting social equity and inclusion in public policy and administration. It seeks to address systemic inequalities and barriers to access and participation in government services, programs, and decision-making processes, particularly for disadvantaged and marginalized groups.
>
> 5. **Public-Private Partnerships**: NPA encourages collaboration and partnerships between government agencies, private sector organizations, non-profit organizations, and community groups to address complex public problems and deliver services more effectively. It recognizes the importance of leveraging diverse resources and expertise to achieve common goals.
>
> 6. **Ethical Leadership**: NPA emphasizes the importance of ethical leadership and integrity in public administration. It calls for public administrators to adhere to high ethical standards, demonstrate honesty, integrity, and accountability in their decision-making and conduct, and act in the best interests of the public.
>
> Overall, New Public Administration represents a paradigm shift in the theory and practice of public administration, moving towards a more inclusive, participatory, and values-driven approach to governance that seeks to address the evolving challenges and complexities of modern society.

In France, the management of the public service aims to focus on social welfare and not financial benefits. However, in fact, the management of public services is not always good; for example, the SNCF. The reason is that it is not result-oriented.

According to the theory of the NPA, it is not important whether public services are run by public administrations or private sectors; what is important is the efficiency and the result of the activities. Efficiency is the standard of good administration. The protection of social welfare is no longer the most important; instead, we want to ensure the results of public activities.

With the development of the NPA, public services started to be privatized, sold off, or transferred to the private sector based on the neoliberal theory that the market is more rational and better able to manage such enterprises.

Some governments wanted to adopt the NPA and reform the French public administration system; that's what triggered the social movements in France because many different social groups are willing to maintain the old model of public service as well as the solidarity between rural and urban areas. There is a dispute between the French principle and the Anglo-Saxon principle of public service.

> The principles and ideas of New Public Administration (NPA) have influenced public administration practices in France, albeit to varying degrees and in different ways. While France has its own distinct administrative traditions and institutions, some aspects of NPA have resonated with French policymakers and scholars, leading to adaptations and reforms within the French public administration system. Here are a few ways in which NPA has influenced France:
>
> 1. **Decentralization and Local Governance**: One aspect of NPA is its emphasis on decentralization and local governance, promoting greater autonomy and decision-making authority at the local level. In France, there has been a gradual trend towards decentralization, with efforts to devolve administrative responsibilities and resources to regional and local governments. This shift reflects a desire to enhance responsiveness, efficiency, and citizen participation in public service delivery.
>
> 2. **Citizen Participation and Engagement**: NPA advocates for increased citizen participation and engagement in public decision-making processes. In France, there has been growing recognition of the importance of citizen involvement in policymaking and governance. Initiatives such as participatory budgeting, citizen consultations, and deliberative democracy forums have been implemented in various municipalities and regions, allowing citizens to have a greater say in local affairs.
>
> 3. **Performance Measurement and Accountability**: NPA promotes the use of performance measurement and accountability mechanisms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public administration. In France, there has been a push towards greater performance-based management in the public sector, with the implementation of performance indicators, evaluation systems, and outcome-based budgeting practices. These measures aim to enhance transparency, accountability, and the delivery of public services.
>
> 4. **Cross-Sector Collaboration**: NPA encourages collaboration and partnerships between government agencies, private sector organizations, non-profit organizations, and civil society groups to address complex public problems. In France, there have been efforts to foster greater collaboration between the public, private, and non-profit sectors through initiatives such as public-private partnerships, social innovation projects, and multi-stakeholder forums. These partnerships aim to leverage diverse resources and expertise to tackle societal challenges more effectively.
>
> 5. **Ethical Leadership and Integrity**: NPA emphasizes the importance of ethical leadership and integrity in public administration. In France, there is a strong emphasis on ethical standards and integrity in the civil service, with codes of conduct, ethics training programs, and anti-corruption measures in place to ensure the highest standards of professional conduct among public officials.
>
> Overall, while France's administrative tradition remains rooted in its own history and institutional context, the principles and ideas of NPA have contributed to ongoing debates and reforms within the French public administration system, shaping policies and practices in areas such as decentralization, citizen engagement, performance management, collaboration, and ethics.

Take farmers protests as an example. Farmers protests are usually linked to the European level because the European Union has a common ruling on the European economy, and the whole of agriculture today in France is regulated by the EU.

The reason for the riot by the farmers is that the rural areas are empty of people because people moved to town, so rural areas lack public service. This is the result of the application of the NPA principle, according to which the government must take into consideration the cost of maintaining public services. In small villages and territories with little population and few economic activities where there aren't enough demands for public services, you will have difficulties finding public services such as doctors and schools. This gives the feeling that no one cares about the people living there. So they wanted to bring back the old French “service publique," with the idea that all people are able to access the public service.

Just like the Gilets jaunes movement with the same purpose. The farmers need public services to live in rural areas. If not, they will have to pay more to gain access to public services in the urban area. Some people live in suburban areas because it is cheaper there, but they still work in big cities, so they need transport.

There are some people who refuse to accept this transformation of the principle of public service. But because of the public debt, it is impossible for the French government to finance these public services. Furthermore, France doesn’t have a political majority party in parliament, so it is hard to make big political decisions relating to the public service system.

### Germanic system

The Germanic legal system developed, more or less, in northern Europe and mainly in Germany.

From the Middle Ages to the 17^th^ and 18^th^ centuries, the territories of Germany and northern Europe were divided into two areas. The southern part was part of French territory, where the Roman law system was adopted. Its legal system was the merger of Roman law and Germanic customs in continental law. In northern Germany and Scandinavia, there was no influence from the Roman law system. The legal system there is the application of local customs that come from different German tribes.

In the 18^th^ century, Prussia was raised with a developed army. Two kings (Frederick William I and Frederick II) made a lot of reforms to the legal system, which were inspired by Roman law.

> In the 18th century, Prussia underwent significant reforms in its legal system under the leadership of several notable Prussian kings, particularly Frederick William I and Frederick II (Frederick the Great). These reforms aimed to modernize and centralize the administration of justice, promote legal uniformity, and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. Some key aspects of the Prussian legal reforms during this period include:
>
> 1. **Codification of Laws**: One of the most significant reforms was the codification of laws to create a unified legal framework. Frederick II initiated the process of codification by commissioning the "Prussian General Law Code" (Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preußischen Staaten) in 1794. This legal code aimed to systematize and simplify the complex patchwork of laws that existed in Prussia at the time, providing a comprehensive set of rules governing civil, criminal, and administrative matters.
>
> 2. **Judicial Reorganization**: The Prussian legal reforms also involved reorganizing the judicial system to improve its efficiency and accessibility. This included establishing a hierarchical system of courts with clear jurisdictional boundaries and procedures. Frederick William I and Frederick II implemented reforms to streamline court procedures, enhance judicial independence, and ensure the impartial administration of justice.
>
> 3. **Legal Rationalism**: The Prussian legal reforms were influenced by the principles of legal rationalism, which emphasized the importance of reason, logic, and uniformity in the law. Legal rationalists sought to create a legal system based on clear and consistent principles, free from arbitrary rulings and privileges. The codification of laws and the establishment of standardized legal procedures were seen as manifestations of this rationalist approach.
>
> 4. **Promotion of Legal Education**: The Prussian kings also promoted legal education and professionalization within the legal profession. They established law schools and academies to train judges, lawyers, and legal scholars, ensuring that the legal system had a well-educated and skilled workforce. These efforts helped to raise the standards of legal practice and expertise in Prussia.
>
> 5. **Centralization of Legal Authority**: The legal reforms in Prussia involved centralizing legal authority under the monarchy's control. Frederick William I and Frederick II sought to consolidate power within the state and reduce the influence of local jurisdictions and feudal privileges. The establishment of a unified legal code and a centralized judiciary helped to strengthen the authority of the Prussian state and promote uniformity in legal administration.
>
> Overall, the legal reforms of the Prussian kings in the 18th century represented a significant modernization and rationalization of the legal system, laying the foundation for the development of a more efficient, centralized, and uniform system of justice in Prussia. These reforms had a lasting impact on the legal and administrative structure of the Prussian state and influenced legal developments in other German territories and beyond.

In the 19^th^ century, most of the various German states were united into the German Empire. During this time, Prussia was the most powerful state and played a leading role in the unification of Germany. The king of Prussia became the emperor of Germany in 1871 and reformed the legal system in Germany.

After unification, the German Empire established a common legal framework. This legal system is derived in part from Napoleonic law, Roman law, and the New Empire, while still keeping a lot of traditions of customs law from the past.

### Roman Dutch system

### The Nordic civil law system

## Common law system
