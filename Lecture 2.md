## Different applications of civil law

The application of civil law is a global and large one; in fact, we have some classifications that are made from a geographical perspective.

### Area of Napoleon system

The Napoleonic legal system was born in western Europe and linked with the development and principles of the French Revolution (principles of unity and general equality).

Napoleon, the son of the revolution, stopped the revolution and created the consulate in 1799, 10 years after the beginning of the French Revolution, which marked the end of the old regime. And the legal system of the First Empire followed the revolution.

> The characterization of Napoleon Bonaparte as the "son of the French Revolution" reflects the significant impact that the French Revolution had on his rise to power and the transformation of France into a modern nation-state. There are several reasons why Napoleon is often associated with the French Revolution:
>
> 1. **Rise to Power**: Napoleon emerged as a prominent military leader during the tumultuous period of the French Revolution. His military successes, particularly during the French Revolutionary Wars, propelled him to prominence within the French government and eventually led to his rise to power as First Consul and later Emperor of the French.
>
> 2. **Continuation of Revolutionary Ideals**: Despite consolidating power and establishing himself as a dictator, Napoleon claimed to be a defender of the revolutionary principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. He implemented legal and administrative reforms that aimed to modernize France and promote social mobility, including the Napoleonic Code, which codified many of the revolutionary legal principles.
>
> 3. **Expansion of Revolutionary Ideals**: Napoleon's conquests across Europe spread revolutionary ideals and institutions, such as the abolition of feudal privileges, the establishment of legal equality, and the secularization of state institutions. His military campaigns aimed to export the principles of the French Revolution to other countries, often by force.
>
> 4. **Centralization of Power**: Napoleon centralized power in France, establishing a strong, centralized state apparatus that was characteristic of the revolutionary era. He implemented administrative reforms, created a merit-based system for government appointments, and centralized control over the military, finances, and legal system.
>
> 5. **Legacy of Revolutionary Wars**: The wars of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars reshaped the political landscape of Europe and contributed to the spread of nationalist sentiment. Napoleon's military campaigns and the upheaval they caused had a profound impact on European politics and society for decades to come.
>
> While Napoleon's rule represented a departure from the democratic aspirations of the early French Revolution, his reign marked a continuation and transformation of the revolutionary legacy. As such, he is often viewed as both a product of the French Revolution and a figure who shaped its legacy in significant ways.

#### The French Revolution and principle of equality

During the old regime, different people had different legal status according to the league they belonged to, their social status (noble or civilian), or their religion. Different territories had different legal systems at that time. For example, Lyon did not have exactly the same law as Grenoble in the old regime; different provinces have different laws.

During the old regime, Jews and Protestants didn't have the same rights as Catholics, which in fact was the state religion. According to the civil law, Jews and Protestants weren’t supposed to exist in the legal system. For example, their marriage would not be recognized if the wedding was not held in a Catholic church, as would their children. As a consequence, their children didn't have inheritance rights.

The legal system was also unfair for foreigners, according to which foreigners like Arabs had to pay additional fees to buy properties.

In 1789, the French Revolution ended this. The *Declaration of Rights* outlines the rights of all men. When Napoleon came into power in 1799, he wanted a unity of law for all people in the whole territory. In the Napoleonic civil code, foreigners have the same rights to sell, buy, and own properties as French citizens. However, there were still dictatorships, meaning that there was no freedom of press and speech, no political freedom, and oppositions were repressed.

> The Napoleonic Code, officially known as the Civil Code of the French Republic (Code civil des Français), was drafted under the leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte's government in France. The drafting process began shortly after Napoleon came to power following the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire in November 1799.
>
> The Napoleonic Code was primarily the work of a commission of legal experts and scholars led by Jean-Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, who was the Second Consul of France and a close associate of Napoleon. The commission was tasked with creating a comprehensive legal code that would unify and modernize the French legal system, replacing the patchwork of laws and customs that existed under the Ancien Régime and the revolutionary period.
>
> The drafting process took several years, with the Napoleonic Code being formally adopted and promulgated on March 21, 1804. This marked the completion of the code and its official entry into force. The Napoleonic Code represented a significant milestone in the history of French law and had a profound impact on legal systems around the world, influencing civil law jurisdictions and serving as a model for subsequent legal codes.

#### The Second Empire in the 19th century

The First Empire is the one after the French Revolution, and the second one was during the 19th century (1852–1871). Napoleon first abdicated and gave his power to his son (Napoleon II), who never reigned and left France to study in Austria. Napoleon III came into power and built the Second Empire, which was more liberal than the first one. At the end of the Second Empire, France was more or less a democratic country.

The industrial revolution happened during the Second Empire, and the economic landscape became different. All systems of trading that are existing today come from the Second Empire. There was the 1867 trade law, which is the foundation of the trade law nowadays. Different types of contracts are also developed.

> The 1867 trade law in France, also known as the "Loi sur la liberté du commerce et de l'industrie" (Law on the Freedom of Trade and Industry), was a significant piece of legislation enacted during the Second Empire under the rule of Emperor Napoleon III. This law aimed to modernize and liberalize France's economic policies, particularly in the areas of trade and industry.
>
> Key provisions of the 1867 trade law included:
>
> 1. **Reduction of Trade Barriers**: The law sought to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers that hindered the free movement of goods within France and with other countries. By promoting free trade, the law aimed to stimulate economic growth, encourage competition, and increase efficiency in the marketplace.
>
> 2. **Protection of Intellectual Property**: The law introduced measures to protect intellectual property rights, including patents and trademarks. This helped to incentivize innovation and creativity by ensuring that inventors and creators could benefit from their work and investments.
>
> 3. **Promotion of Industrialization**: The law included provisions to support industrial development and modernization in France. This included measures to encourage investment in manufacturing, infrastructure, and technology, as well as the establishment of industrial zones and trade fairs to showcase French products.
>
> 4. **Regulation of Labor Relations**: The law addressed labor relations and working conditions in French industries. While it did not provide comprehensive labor protections, it introduced some regulations aimed at improving conditions for workers, such as limitations on working hours and child labor.
>
> 5. **Encouragement of Entrepreneurship**: The law aimed to promote entrepreneurship and small business development by reducing bureaucratic barriers to starting and operating businesses. This included simplifying administrative procedures and providing support for entrepreneurs and startups.
>
> Overall, the 1867 trade law in France represented a significant step towards modernizing and liberalizing the country's economy during the Second Empire. It reflected the broader economic policies of Napoleon III's regime, which sought to balance the interests of industry, commerce, and labor while promoting economic growth and national prosperity.

The system of cooperation (Société anonyme) developed.

> "==Société anonyme==" is a French term that translates to "anonymous society" in English. In legal terms, it refers to a type of business entity or corporation characterized by the following features:
>
> 1. **Limited Liability**: Shareholders of a société anonyme have limited liability, meaning their personal assets are generally protected from the debts and liabilities of the company. In the event of bankruptcy or legal claims against the company, shareholders are typically only liable for the amount of their investment in the company.
>
> 2. **Separate Legal Personality**: Like other forms of corporations, a société anonyme has a separate legal personality distinct from its shareholders. This means the company can own property, enter into contracts, and sue or be sued in its own name.
>
> 3. **Ownership by Shareholders**: The ownership of a société anonyme is represented by shares, which are owned by shareholders. Shareholders elect a board of directors to oversee the management of the company on their behalf.
>
> 4. **Public or Private**: A société anonyme can be either publicly traded or privately held. Publicly traded companies are listed on a stock exchange and their shares are available for purchase by the public. Private companies, on the other hand, have a limited number of shareholders and their shares are not traded on a public market.
>
> 5. **Regulated by Law**: The formation and operation of a société anonyme are governed by legal regulations specific to the jurisdiction in which it is established. These regulations typically address matters such as corporate governance, shareholder rights, financial reporting, and disclosure requirements.
>
> Overall, a société anonyme is a commonly used legal structure for businesses in France and other jurisdictions, offering advantages such as limited liability for shareholders and flexibility in ownership and management. It is often used for medium to large-sized companies with multiple shareholders and complex business operations.

The main codex in France, which had been voted during the First Empire, the civil code, criminal code, and trade code, had been conserved during the regimes because it was efficient and good.

#### The spread of the Napoleonic legal system

The legal system in France had also been applied in other European countries during the First Empire. At that time, a large part of Europe was incorporated into the French Empire, and there were 140 departments in the French Empire (nowadays, there are only 100 departments in the republic). In fact, the French Empire conquered many territories during the industrial revolution, including Genève in Switzerland and Belgium. There were applications of French laws, codes, and institutions (préfet) at the end of the 19^th^ century in these territories.

France and other countries were greatly impacted by the Roman Empire. The finding of Pompeii's ruins indicates that the Roman Empire had a significant influence on French art and furnishings. In the Roman era, the senate (sénat) in the Roman assembly had strong and fair power. The similar institution was adopted by multiple countries, and sénats were established. French territories shared all of the same institutions and organizations as France When they were a part of the French Empire.

> Italy was part of the French Empire under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte during the Napoleonic era. Napoleon's military campaigns and conquests in Italy led to significant changes in the political landscape of the Italian peninsula.
>
> During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon conquered and annexed several regions of Italy, including the Kingdom of Italy, which he established in 1805. The Kingdom of Italy was initially a puppet state controlled by Napoleon, with himself as its king. The capital of the Kingdom of Italy was established in Milan.
>
> Napoleon's control over Italy extended beyond the Kingdom of Italy. He also exerted influence over other Italian states and territories, either directly through annexation or indirectly through alliances and client states. For example, the Kingdom of Naples and the Papal States were among the regions that came under French control or influence during Napoleon's rule.
>
> Napoleon's reforms in Italy aimed to centralize administration, modernize governance, and implement legal and social reforms based on the principles of the French Revolution. These reforms included the introduction of the Napoleonic legal code, the abolition of feudal privileges, the establishment of new administrative divisions, and the promotion of economic development and infrastructure projects.
>
> Overall, Italy was a significant part of the French Empire during the Napoleonic era, with Napoleon exerting considerable influence over the region through conquest, annexation, and political alliances. His rule had a lasting impact on Italy's political, social, and cultural development during this period.

The result of the Congress of Vienna was that France would remain what it was before the Revolution. However, the new succeeding authorities decided to keep the French codes and institutions because this system was considered very modern and efficient. Nowadays, if you compare the main principles of Italy, the Netherlands, southern Germany, etc., the philosophy is the same. The influences of Roman law were also kept.

> The Congress of Vienna was a major international conference held in Vienna, Austria, from September 1814 to June 1815. It was convened to reorganize Europe in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars and to restore stability and order to the continent after decades of upheaval.
>
>Key objectives of the Congress of Vienna included:
>
> 1. **Redrawing the Map of Europe**: The Congress aimed to redraw the boundaries of European states that had been altered by Napoleon's conquests and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. The goal was to establish a new balance of power among the European nations to prevent future conflicts.
>
> 2. **Restoring Legitimate Monarchies**: The Congress sought to restore legitimate monarchies and dynasties that had been displaced or overthrown during the Napoleonic era. This involved reinstating ruling families to their thrones and suppressing revolutionary movements and nationalist uprisings.
>
> 3. **Maintaining Stability and Order**: The Congress aimed to establish mechanisms for maintaining stability and order in Europe, including collective security arrangements and diplomatic protocols. This included the establishment of the Concert of Europe, a system of regular diplomatic meetings among the major European powers to address common concerns and prevent conflicts.
>
> 4. **Conservative Diplomacy**: The Congress of Vienna was characterized by conservative diplomacy, with a focus on restoring traditional institutions, values, and social hierarchies. This approach reflected the prevailing sentiment among European leaders who sought to roll back the revolutionary changes brought about by the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars.
>
> The Congress of Vienna was attended by representatives from most of the major European powers, including Austria, Britain, France, Prussia, and Russia. The negotiations were led by prominent diplomats and statesmen, such as Klemens von Metternich of Austria, Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh of Britain, and Prince Talleyrand of France.
>
> The decisions made at the Congress of Vienna had a profound impact on the political map of Europe and shaped the continent's geopolitical landscape for decades to come. While the Congress succeeded in restoring stability to Europe in the short term, it also laid the groundwork for future tensions and conflicts, particularly as nationalist aspirations and rivalries continued to simmer beneath the surface.

France had multiple colonial empires where the French law system applied, including many Muslim countries. There was the "**domestic principle**." In the colonies, the Muslim population was ruled by Muslim law, while the French legal system applied to the French population and foreigners coming from other areas.

> The "==domestic principle== (principe de l'indigénat in French)" in the context of the French colonial legal system refers to a legal doctrine that governed the administration of justice within French colonies. This principle dictated that the laws and legal institutions of France applied within the colonial territories, effectively extending French law to overseas territories.
>
> From a legal perspective, the domestic principle had several key implications:
>
> 1. **Application of French Law**: Under the domestic principle, French colonial authorities applied French law within the colonies, including both statutory law enacted by the French government and customary law derived from French legal traditions. This meant that French legal norms, procedures, and principles governed various aspects of colonial life, such as civil rights, property rights, criminal justice, and commercial transactions.
>
> 2. **Uniformity and Centralization**: The domestic principle aimed to promote uniformity and centralization in the administration of justice across the French empire. By applying French law in the colonies, colonial administrators sought to ensure consistency in legal practices and outcomes, as well as to reinforce the authority of the French state over colonial subjects and territories.
>
> 3. **Extension of French Legal Institutions**: In addition to applying French law, the domestic principle also involved the extension of French legal institutions, such as courts, administrative bodies, and legal professionals, to the colonies. French colonial authorities established courts and tribunals in the colonies that operated according to French legal procedures and jurisprudence, with judges appointed by the French government.
>
> 4. **Assimilation and Integration**: The domestic principle reflected the colonial policy of assimilation, which aimed to integrate colonial subjects into French society and culture by imposing French legal norms and institutions upon them. Through the application of French law, colonial administrators sought to impose French values, customs, and standards of behavior on indigenous populations, often at the expense of local legal traditions and practices.
>
> 5. **Colonial Resistance and Adaptation**: While the domestic principle provided a legal framework for colonial rule, it also faced resistance and adaptation from colonial subjects who sought to assert their own legal traditions, identities, and rights. Indigenous peoples often challenged the imposition of French law and institutions, leading to conflicts, negotiations, and accommodations between colonial authorities and local communities.
>
> Overall, the domestic principle played a central role in shaping the legal framework of French colonialism, emphasizing the extension of French law and institutions to overseas territories as a means of asserting colonial control and promoting assimilation. However, it also generated tensions and complexities as colonial subjects negotiated their legal identities and rights within the context of colonial rule.

In the French legal system, there is the notion of “**service publique**," which means service that is ruled by the administration with the purpose of social welfare, such as public universities, public hospitals, etc. The idea is that they are organized and ruled by the government, not like money-making classical trade but for the purpose of social welfare.

In some colonies, the Muslims are ruled by Muslim law in the private domain, including marriage, inheritance, some taxes, contracts, etc. While in the public domain, such as public service and administration, French laws were applied, making the institution more western.

The general application of French law: in French territories such as Madagascar (l'île de la réunion), when the French troops arrived, there were no inhabitants in the territory; in this case, all the population were ruled by the general French law.

The justice systems in French colonies are also inspired by the French legal system. There were French justice systems for the application of French law, but Muslin justice instructions also existed for the Muslin law. For example, in Algeria, where the majority are Muslims, before its independence, we had the national justice system inspired by the French system and local Muslim tribunals that existed mainly for family law. The **Wilayas** (provinces) in Algeria look like French departments, where there is a prefecture and the administrative code is applied with the principles of service publique.

After Algeria became independent, a huge part of the French legal system was kept. Nowadays, the main difference between the Algerian legal system and the French legal system is the family law, since the family law in Algeria is inspired by Islamic law, but they are quite close in other domains. The link between the two legal systems still exists, and the influence continues. There are many cooperations between France and its formal colonies; people come from formal colonies to France for internships and studies.

There are other countries whose legal systems are inspired by the French legal system, not because of colonization but because they think the French legal system is good. For example, the Malta island, which is a former British colony, had many lawyers study in France and Italy. Therefore, Malta is influenced by the civil law system rather than the British common law system. There are some South-American countries, like Chile, whose legal systems are also influenced by the French legal system.

#### Concept of public service

During the 1950s and 1960s, the French legal system was very well recognized in many other countries whose lawyers studied the French legal system. These countries established French-style public administrations inspired by French conceptions of public service.

In the 1970s, the School of New Public Administration developed in the US, where there was rapid growth in the public service due to extensive suburbanization and urbanization. This theory, which also emphasizes the importance of results and benefits, has nowadays become the main theory of public administration and has substituted for the French theory in many foreign countries.

> ==New Public Administration== (NPA) is a term that refers to a movement within the field of public administration that emerged in the United States during the late 20th century. NPA represents a shift away from traditional bureaucratic models of public administration towards a more humanistic, democratic, and participatory approach to governance.
>
> Key features of New Public Administration include:
>
> 1. **Emphasis on Public Service Values**: NPA advocates for a focus on public service values such as accountability, transparency, equity, and social justice. It emphasizes the importance of public administrators serving the public interest and addressing the needs of all citizens, particularly marginalized and underserved populations.
>
> 2. **Democratic Governance**: NPA promotes democratic principles and practices within public administration, including citizen participation, deliberative decision-making processes, and collaboration between government agencies, civil society organizations, and citizens. It seeks to enhance the democratic legitimacy and responsiveness of public institutions.
>
> 3. **Management Reform**: NPA calls for reforms in the management and organization of public agencies to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and responsiveness. This includes adopting management techniques from the private sector, such as performance measurement, strategic planning, and outcome-based evaluation, while also recognizing the unique challenges and responsibilities of public service delivery.
>
> 4. **Social Equity and Inclusion**: NPA places a strong emphasis on promoting social equity and inclusion in public policy and administration. It seeks to address systemic inequalities and barriers to access and participation in government services, programs, and decision-making processes, particularly for disadvantaged and marginalized groups.
>
> 5. **Public-Private Partnerships**: NPA encourages collaboration and partnerships between government agencies, private sector organizations, non-profit organizations, and community groups to address complex public problems and deliver services more effectively. It recognizes the importance of leveraging diverse resources and expertise to achieve common goals.
>
> 6. **Ethical Leadership**: NPA emphasizes the importance of ethical leadership and integrity in public administration. It calls for public administrators to adhere to high ethical standards, demonstrate honesty, integrity, and accountability in their decision-making and conduct, and act in the best interests of the public.
>
> Overall, New Public Administration represents a paradigm shift in the theory and practice of public administration, moving towards a more inclusive, participatory, and values-driven approach to governance that seeks to address the evolving challenges and complexities of modern society.

In France, the management of the public service aims to focus on social welfare and not financial benefits. However, in fact, the management of public services is not always good; for example, the SNCF. The reason is that it is not result-oriented.

According to the theory of the NPA, it is not important whether public services are run by public administrations or private sectors; what is important is the efficiency and the result of the activities. Efficiency is the standard of good administration. The protection of social welfare is no longer the most important; instead, we want to ensure the results of public activities.

With the development of the NPA, public services started to be privatized, sold off, or transferred to the private sector based on the neoliberal theory that the market is more rational and better able to manage such enterprises.

Some governments wanted to adopt the NPA and reform the French public administration system; that's what triggered the social movements in France because many different social groups are willing to maintain the old model of public service as well as the solidarity between rural and urban areas. There is a dispute between the French principle and the Anglo-Saxon principle of public service.

> The principles and ideas of New Public Administration (NPA) have influenced public administration practices in France, albeit to varying degrees and in different ways. While France has its own distinct administrative traditions and institutions, some aspects of NPA have resonated with French policymakers and scholars, leading to adaptations and reforms within the French public administration system. Here are a few ways in which NPA has influenced France:
>
> 1. **Decentralization and Local Governance**: One aspect of NPA is its emphasis on decentralization and local governance, promoting greater autonomy and decision-making authority at the local level. In France, there has been a gradual trend towards decentralization, with efforts to devolve administrative responsibilities and resources to regional and local governments. This shift reflects a desire to enhance responsiveness, efficiency, and citizen participation in public service delivery.
>
> 2. **Citizen Participation and Engagement**: NPA advocates for increased citizen participation and engagement in public decision-making processes. In France, there has been growing recognition of the importance of citizen involvement in policymaking and governance. Initiatives such as participatory budgeting, citizen consultations, and deliberative democracy forums have been implemented in various municipalities and regions, allowing citizens to have a greater say in local affairs.
>
> 3. **Performance Measurement and Accountability**: NPA promotes the use of performance measurement and accountability mechanisms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public administration. In France, there has been a push towards greater performance-based management in the public sector, with the implementation of performance indicators, evaluation systems, and outcome-based budgeting practices. These measures aim to enhance transparency, accountability, and the delivery of public services.
>
> 4. **Cross-Sector Collaboration**: NPA encourages collaboration and partnerships between government agencies, private sector organizations, non-profit organizations, and civil society groups to address complex public problems. In France, there have been efforts to foster greater collaboration between the public, private, and non-profit sectors through initiatives such as public-private partnerships, social innovation projects, and multi-stakeholder forums. These partnerships aim to leverage diverse resources and expertise to tackle societal challenges more effectively.
>
> 5. **Ethical Leadership and Integrity**: NPA emphasizes the importance of ethical leadership and integrity in public administration. In France, there is a strong emphasis on ethical standards and integrity in the civil service, with codes of conduct, ethics training programs, and anti-corruption measures in place to ensure the highest standards of professional conduct among public officials.
>
> Overall, while France's administrative tradition remains rooted in its own history and institutional context, the principles and ideas of NPA have contributed to ongoing debates and reforms within the French public administration system, shaping policies and practices in areas such as decentralization, citizen engagement, performance management, collaboration, and ethics.

Take farmers protests as an example. Farmers protests are usually linked to the European level because the European Union has a common ruling on the European economy, and the whole of agriculture today in France is regulated by the EU.

The reason for the riot by the farmers is that the rural areas are empty of people because people moved to town, so rural areas lack public service. This is the result of the application of the NPA principle, according to which the government must take into consideration the cost of maintaining public services. In small villages and territories with little population and few economic activities where there aren't enough demands for public services, you will have difficulties finding public services such as doctors and schools. This gives the feeling that no one cares about the people living there. So they wanted to bring back the old French “service publique," with the idea that all people are able to access the public service.

Just like the Gilets jaunes movement with the same purpose. The farmers need public services to live in rural areas. If not, they will have to pay more to gain access to public services in the urban area. Some people live in suburban areas because it is cheaper there, but they still work in big cities, so they need transport.

There are some people who refuse to accept this transformation of the principle of public service. But because of the public debt, it is impossible for the French government to finance these public services. Furthermore, France doesn’t have a political majority party in parliament, so it is hard to make big political decisions relating to the public service system.

### Germanic system

The Germanic legal system developed, more or less, in northern Europe and mainly in Germany.

From the Middle Ages to the 17^th^ and 18^th^ centuries, the territories of Germany and northern Europe were divided into two areas. The southern part was part of French territory, where the Roman law system was adopted. Its legal system was the merger of Roman law and Germanic customs in continental law. In northern Germany and Scandinavia, there was no influence from the Roman law system. The legal system there is the application of local customs that come from different German tribes.

In the 18^th^ century, Prussia was raised with a developed army. Two kings (Frederick William I and Frederick II) made a lot of reforms to the legal system, which were inspired by Roman law.

> In the 18th century, Prussia underwent significant reforms in its legal system under the leadership of several notable Prussian kings, particularly Frederick William I and Frederick II (Frederick the Great). These reforms aimed to modernize and centralize the administration of justice, promote legal uniformity, and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. Some key aspects of the Prussian legal reforms during this period include:
>
> 1. **Codification of Laws**: One of the most significant reforms was the codification of laws to create a unified legal framework. Frederick II initiated the process of codification by commissioning the "Prussian General Law Code" (Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preußischen Staaten) in 1794. This legal code aimed to systematize and simplify the complex patchwork of laws that existed in Prussia at the time, providing a comprehensive set of rules governing civil, criminal, and administrative matters.
>
> 2. **Judicial Reorganization**: The Prussian legal reforms also involved reorganizing the judicial system to improve its efficiency and accessibility. This included establishing a hierarchical system of courts with clear jurisdictional boundaries and procedures. Frederick William I and Frederick II implemented reforms to streamline court procedures, enhance judicial independence, and ensure the impartial administration of justice.
>
> 3. **Legal Rationalism**: The Prussian legal reforms were influenced by the principles of legal rationalism, which emphasized the importance of reason, logic, and uniformity in the law. Legal rationalists sought to create a legal system based on clear and consistent principles, free from arbitrary rulings and privileges. The codification of laws and the establishment of standardized legal procedures were seen as manifestations of this rationalist approach.
>
> 4. **Promotion of Legal Education**: The Prussian kings also promoted legal education and professionalization within the legal profession. They established law schools and academies to train judges, lawyers, and legal scholars, ensuring that the legal system had a well-educated and skilled workforce. These efforts helped to raise the standards of legal practice and expertise in Prussia.
>
> 5. **Centralization of Legal Authority**: The legal reforms in Prussia involved centralizing legal authority under the monarchy's control. Frederick William I and Frederick II sought to consolidate power within the state and reduce the influence of local jurisdictions and feudal privileges. The establishment of a unified legal code and a centralized judiciary helped to strengthen the authority of the Prussian state and promote uniformity in legal administration.
>
> Overall, the legal reforms of the Prussian kings in the 18th century represented a significant modernization and rationalization of the legal system, laying the foundation for the development of a more efficient, centralized, and uniform system of justice in Prussia. These reforms had a lasting impact on the legal and administrative structure of the Prussian state and influenced legal developments in other German territories and beyond.

In the 19^th^ century, most of the various German states were united into the German Empire. During this time, Prussia was the most powerful state and played a leading role in the unification of Germany. The king of Prussia became the emperor of Germany in 1871 and reformed the legal system in Germany.

After unification, the German Empire established a common legal framework. This legal system is derived in part from Napoleonic law, Roman law, and the New Empire, while still keeping a lot of traditions of customs law from the past.

The new German Empire is a federalist state. At the federal level, the Napoleonic civil law system is applied, while at the local level, traditional principles and customs are kept. But at the end of World War I, there was a large development of domination from the federal level (the Prussian level) over the local level. There was no equality between different states; it was clear that, in reality, the power was in Berlin and in the Kingdom of Prussia.

At the end of the 19^th^ century and the first half of the 20^th^ century, there was competition between France and Germany. The Prussian government decided that it was not fair to follow the principles of civil law that came from the Napoleonic legal system. Nationalists believed that since Germany defeated France, there was no reason for Germany to keep using the French legal system; Germans were the winners and should follow their own law. There was also an academic fight between French and German lawyers. They had different views, and many articles were written from both sides against each other.

In 1900, a new German civil code, the *Burgerliches Gesetzbuch*, was developed. It is the most generally applicable private law, and it had real success and influence outside Germany as well.

> "Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch," often abbreviated as "BGB," is the German term for "Civil Code." It is the main codification of private law in Germany, governing various aspects of civil law, including contracts, property, family law, inheritance, and torts.
>
> The Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB) was enacted in 1900 and came into force on January 1, 1900. It replaced the diverse legal systems that existed in different German states with a unified and modernized legal framework. The BGB was a significant legal reform aimed at streamlining and codifying civil law principles throughout the German Empire.
>
> The BGB is divided into several books, each covering different areas of private law:
>
> 1. Book 1: General Part (Allgemeiner Teil) - This book contains general principles of civil law, such as legal capacity, legal transactions, representation, and limitation periods.
>
> 2. Book 2: Law of Obligations (Schuldrecht) - This book deals with contractual obligations, including formation of contracts, performance, breach of contract, and remedies for breach.
>
> 3. Book 3: Property Law (Sachenrecht) - This book regulates property rights, including ownership, possession, and rights in rem.
>
> 4. Book 4: Family Law (Familienrecht) - This book covers family relationships, including marriage, divorce, parentage, and custody.
>
> 5. Book 5: Law of Succession (Erbrecht) - This book governs inheritance and succession, including wills, intestate succession, and estate administration.
>
> The BGB is considered one of the most influential civil codes in the world and has served as a model for civil law systems in other countries. It has been amended and updated over the years to reflect changes in society, legal doctrine, and jurisprudence.

The BGB came with a very modern concept. The French civil code, during this century, appeared to be an old text and not very applicable to the new economic conditions. The new German civil code is applicable to the period of the industrial revolution.

The BGB has a new philosophy of law, different from the philosophy influenced by French civil law in the 19th century, when academics used to teach the concept of philosophy of law, reflection of law in general, and elements of reflection. All these came to an end with the appearance of BGB.

Many other countries called on German legal expertise for help constructing their own legal systems based on the German civil code. This was the case for Japan in the Meiji era, when Japan also made the division of prefecture.

> The Meiji era in Japan refers to a period of significant political, social, and cultural transformation that occurred during the reign of Emperor Meiji, who ruled from 1868 to 1912. The Meiji era is one of the most pivotal periods in Japanese history and is often characterized by modernization, industrialization, and the establishment of Japan as a major world power.
>
> The Meiji Restoration, which began in 1868, marked the end of the feudal Tokugawa shogunate and the restoration of imperial rule under Emperor Meiji. The Meiji government embarked on a series of ambitious reforms aimed at modernizing and strengthening Japan's economy, military, and institutions.
>
> During the Meiji Restoration period, Japan reorganized its provinces. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan embarked on modernization reforms, including restructuring its administrative divisions. The Meiji government abolished the feudal han system and replaced it with prefectures and counties, gradually implementing a modern system of local governance.

The BGB has influence in France as well. Some reforms of French law have been made in the 20 years following the BGB. Firm law and commercial law in France are influenced by the BGB.

*Take SARL (société à responsabilité limitée), a specific body for small businesses, as an example. Germany has a very efficient trade system, even for small enterprises, while the French one is good for big companies. It was dangerous if the company was not a success because financial responsibility is based on the owner. It would be a real catastrophe if you lost money because the bank would take back the money from the owner. There is no specific status for the company.*

> The Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB), enacted in Germany in 1900, served as a model for legal reform efforts in various countries, including France. While the BGB primarily focused on civil law matters, its codification and modernization of legal principles also had implications for French firm law and commercial law. Here are some ways in which French firm law and commercial law were influenced or modified after the enactment of the BGB:
>
> 1. **Codification and Systematization**: Like the BGB, French legal scholars and lawmakers sought to codify and systematize the law relating to firms and commercial transactions. The BGB's structured organization and clear rules inspired similar efforts in France to codify commercial law.
>
> 2. **Modernization of Contract Law**: The BGB introduced modern contract law principles, such as freedom of contract, good faith, and fairness, which influenced French contract law reform efforts. These principles aimed to provide clarity and predictability in commercial transactions, fostering economic development and trade.
>
> 3. **Emphasis on Legal Certainty**: The BGB emphasized legal certainty and predictability in commercial transactions, which became guiding principles for French legal reforms. Clarity and certainty in legal rules were seen as essential for fostering business confidence and promoting economic growth.
>
> 4. **Recognition of Commercial Practices**: The BGB recognized and incorporated commercial practices and customs into its legal framework, providing flexibility and adaptability to changing business realities. French lawmakers also sought to accommodate commercial practices and customs within the legal system to ensure that the law remained relevant and effective in regulating commercial activities.
>
> 5. **Influence on Legal Education and Scholarship**: The BGB's codification of legal principles and its systematic approach influenced legal education and scholarship in France. French legal scholars studied and analyzed the BGB, incorporating its principles and methodologies into their own work and contributing to the development of French commercial law.
>
> 6. **Harmonization with International Standards**: The BGB's adoption of modern legal principles aligned with international standards, facilitating the harmonization of French commercial law with international norms and practices. French lawmakers looked to the BGB and other modern legal codes as models for updating and modernizing French commercial law to meet international standards.
>
> Overall, while the BGB directly impacted German law, its influence extended beyond Germany's borders and contributed to legal reform efforts in other countries, including France. The BGB's emphasis on modernization, legal certainty, and commercial practices inspired similar efforts to reform and modernize French firm law and commercial law in the early 20th century.

The BGB influenced the French judicial system because, following Germany's defeat in World War I, Alsace-Lorraine, a former German territory, reverted to France. The BGB applied in this region was extended to the rest of France.

Other countries whose legal systems have been influenced by the BGB are Austria, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries.

### Roman Dutch system

Practically no code. In these countries, they don’t use the system of codes, or very few. Influenced by the BGB and some codes of European law.

> The Roman-Dutch legal system is a legal tradition that emerged in the Netherlands during the Middle Ages and was later transplanted to the Dutch colonies, including South Africa, Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), and Indonesia (formerly the Dutch East Indies). The Roman-Dutch legal system is characterized by its unique blend of Roman law principles and Dutch legal traditions, along with influences from indigenous customary law and local practices.
>
> Here are some key characteristics of the Roman-Dutch legal system:
>
> 1. **Roman Law Influence**: The Roman-Dutch legal system is rooted in Roman law principles, particularly those developed under the Roman Empire. Roman law provided a foundation for legal concepts such as property rights, contracts, and obligations, which were incorporated into the legal systems of the Netherlands and its colonies.
>
> 2. **Dutch Legal Tradition**: In addition to Roman law, the Roman-Dutch legal system also incorporates elements of Dutch legal traditions and practices. Dutch legal scholars and jurists played a significant role in shaping and developing the legal system, adapting Roman law principles to fit the needs and circumstances of Dutch society.
>
> 3. **Case Law**: Like the common law system, the Roman-Dutch legal system relies heavily on judicial decisions and precedent. Courts interpret and apply the law based on previous judgments and established legal principles, leading to the development of a body of case law that guides future legal decisions.
>
> 4. **Civil Law Structure**: The Roman-Dutch legal system follows a civil law structure, with comprehensive codes and statutes governing various areas of law. However, unlike purely civil law systems, the Roman-Dutch legal system also incorporates elements of common law, particularly in the area of precedent-based decision-making.
>
> 5. **Customary Law**: In addition to formal legal codes and statutes, the Roman-Dutch legal system recognizes and incorporates customary law and local practices, particularly in the Dutch colonies. Indigenous customs and traditions were respected and applied alongside Roman-Dutch legal principles, leading to a hybrid legal system that reflects the diversity of the colonial societies.
>
> 6. **Continental Influence**: While the Roman-Dutch legal system shares similarities with common law systems, it is more closely aligned with continental European legal traditions. The influence of Roman law, Dutch legal principles, and indigenous customs gives the Roman-Dutch legal system a distinct character that sets it apart from both common law and purely civil law systems.
>
> Overall, the Roman-Dutch legal system is characterized by its synthesis of Roman law, Dutch legal traditions, and local customs, creating a unique and adaptable legal framework that has left a lasting legacy in former Dutch colonies around the world.

### The Nordic civil law system

> The Nordic civil law system, also known as the Scandinavian legal tradition, is a legal system primarily found in the Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland. While each Nordic country has its own legal framework and legal traditions, they share common principles and characteristics that distinguish them from other legal systems. Here are some key features of the Nordic civil law system:
>
> 1. **Civil Law Tradition**: The Nordic legal systems are based on civil law principles, which emphasize written laws and statutes as the primary source of law. Unlike common law systems, which rely heavily on judicial precedent, the Nordic civil law system is characterized by comprehensive legal codes and statutes that govern various areas of law.
>
> 2. **Codification**: One of the defining features of the Nordic civil law system is the extensive codification of laws and regulations. Legal codes cover a wide range of topics, including civil law, criminal law, administrative law, and procedural law. These codes provide clear and detailed rules for individuals, organizations, and governments to follow, promoting legal certainty and predictability.
>
> 3. **Legal Uniformity**: The Nordic countries place a strong emphasis on legal uniformity and consistency across different areas of law. While each country has its own legal codes and statutes, there is a degree of harmonization and standardization of laws among the Nordic countries, particularly in areas such as contract law, property law, and commercial law.
>
> 4. **Judicial Independence**: The Nordic civil law system upholds the principle of judicial independence, ensuring that judges are impartial and free from external influence in their decision-making. Courts play a central role in interpreting and applying the law, resolving disputes, and upholding individual rights and liberties.
>
> 5. **Legal Education and Profession**: Legal education and the practice of law in the Nordic countries are characterized by a high level of professionalism and expertise. Legal professionals, including judges, lawyers, and legal scholars, undergo rigorous training and education to ensure a thorough understanding of legal principles and procedures.
>
> 6. **Social Welfare Orientation**: The Nordic civil law system reflects the social welfare orientation of Nordic societies, with an emphasis on principles such as equality, social justice, and solidarity. Legal protections for workers, consumers, and vulnerable populations are often more extensive in Nordic legal systems compared to other jurisdictions.
>
>Overall, the Nordic civil law system is characterized by its emphasis on written laws, codification, legal uniformity, judicial independence, and social welfare orientation. While each Nordic country has its own legal traditions and nuances, they share common principles and values that underpin their legal frameworks.

In Scandinavia, there used to be local customs until they came to the civil code systems through the influence of the Napoleonic legal system. They have codes for some important aspects, but not for all the subjects.

Denmark was allied with France, so there was cooperation between the two countries and academic cooperation with lawyers.

In Sweden, King Bernadotte, who had French origins and was a Marshal of France, came to the throne. One of his sons, Oscar I, studied in France. That's how the Swedish legal system was influenced by the Napoleonic legal system. Later, the Swedish legal system was influenced by the German BGB.

> The introduction of the Napoleonic legal system in Sweden was primarily carried out by King Charles XIV John (formerly Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte), who ascended to the Swedish throne in 1818. As a former French military officer and Marshal of the French Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte, Charles XIV John brought with him a familiarity with the Napoleonic legal system and a desire to modernize Sweden's legal framework. Under his reign, Sweden underwent significant legal reforms influenced by the Napoleonic Code, including the codification of laws and the modernization of civil law. These reforms helped shape the Swedish legal system into its contemporary form.

Norway became independent in 1905, and like Denmark and Sweden, its legal system was influenced by the French legal system.

> The legal systems in Scandinavia have evolved over centuries and have been influenced by various historical, cultural, and political factors. Here is a brief overview of the history of legal systems in Scandinavia:
>
> 1. **Medieval Period**: During the medieval period, Scandinavian societies were characterized by tribal laws and customary practices. These laws varied among different regions and were often orally transmitted. However, as centralized monarchies began to emerge in the region, efforts were made to codify and standardize legal practices.
>
> 2. **Christianization and Canon Law**: With the Christianization of Scandinavia in the Middle Ages, canon law became increasingly influential in shaping legal institutions and practices. Ecclesiastical courts were established to adjudicate matters related to church law, while secular rulers began to assert their authority over legal matters previously governed by tribal customs.
>
> 3. **Union Periods**: Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were united at various points in history, leading to the development of shared legal institutions and practices. For example, during the Kalmar Union (1397-1523), which united Denmark, Norway, and Sweden under a single monarch, efforts were made to harmonize legal systems across the union.
>
> 4. **Codification and Modernization**: In the 19th century, efforts were made to modernize and codify legal systems in Scandinavia. Inspired by the codification movements in continental Europe, countries such as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden adopted comprehensive legal codes covering various areas of law, including civil law, criminal law, and procedural law.
>
> 5. **Constitutional Reforms**: The 19th century also saw the emergence of constitutional reforms in Scandinavia, with the establishment of constitutional monarchies and the adoption of written constitutions. These constitutions enshrined fundamental rights and established the framework for modern democratic governance.
>
> 6. **Social Welfare State**: In the 20th century, Scandinavia emerged as a model for social welfare states, with extensive social welfare programs and protections for workers, families, and vulnerable populations. Legal reforms were enacted to strengthen labor rights, expand social insurance programs, and promote equality and social justice.
>
> 7. **European Integration**: In recent decades, Scandinavian legal systems have been influenced by European integration and the harmonization of laws within the European Union. Membership in the EU has led to the adoption of EU directives and regulations, which have had implications for various areas of law, including trade, competition, and human rights.
>
>Overall, the legal systems in Scandinavia have evolved from tribal customs and customary practices to modern, codified legal frameworks characterized by democratic governance, rule of law, and social welfare protections. While each Scandinavian country has its own legal traditions and institutions, there are also shared legal principles and values that reflect the region's historical and cultural heritage.

## Common law system

The common law system exists mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries and is not based on statutory law. Anglo-Saxon is a term used to describe the people who, from the 5^th^ century to the time of the Norman conquest, inhabited and ruled territories that today are part of England and Wales.

The common law system is largely based on customs and on the system of juridical precedent. Therefore, it is the body of law created by judges and similar quasi-judicial tribunals by virtue of being stated in written opinions.

> ==Quasi-judicial tribunals== are administrative bodies or agencies that have been granted powers to adjudicate disputes and make decisions that resemble those made by traditional courts. These tribunals operate outside the regular court system but are tasked with resolving specific types of disputes or enforcing certain regulatory regimes.
>
> Key characteristics of quasi-judicial tribunals include:
>
> 1. **Limited Jurisdiction**: Quasi-judicial tribunals typically have jurisdiction over specific areas of law or subject matter. For example, they may handle disputes related to labor relations, immigration, taxation, environmental regulations, or professional licensing.
>
> 2. **Adjudicative Functions**: Quasi-judicial tribunals conduct hearings, receive evidence, and make decisions or rulings on legal matters within their jurisdiction. These decisions may involve resolving disputes between parties, issuing permits or licenses, imposing penalties or sanctions, or interpreting and applying relevant laws or regulations.
>
> 3. **Procedural Rules**: Quasi-judicial tribunals often have their own procedural rules governing the conduct of hearings, the presentation of evidence, and the rights of parties involved. While these rules may differ from those in traditional courts, they are designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and due process.
>
> 4. **Expertise and Specialization**: Quasi-judicial tribunals are often staffed by members or adjudicators with expertise in the subject matter over which they have jurisdiction. This specialization allows them to apply technical knowledge and understanding of specific laws or regulations to the cases before them.
>
> 5. **Limited Review**: Decisions made by quasi-judicial tribunals are subject to review, but the scope of review may be limited compared to appeals from traditional courts. Review may be conducted by higher administrative bodies, specialized tribunals, or, in some cases, by the regular court system on grounds such as errors of law or jurisdictional issues.
>
> Examples of quasi-judicial tribunals include:
>
> - Employment tribunals, which adjudicate disputes between employers and employees regarding employment rights, discrimination, and workplace grievances.
> - Tax tribunals, which hear appeals related to tax assessments, disputes over tax liabilities, and other tax-related matters.
> - Environmental tribunals, which address disputes concerning environmental regulations, permits, pollution control, and resource management.
> - Professional regulatory bodies, which oversee the licensing, discipline, and conduct of professionals such as lawyers, doctors, engineers, and accountants.
>
> Overall, quasi-judicial tribunals play a crucial role in the administrative justice system, providing specialized dispute resolution mechanisms and enforcing regulatory compliance in various areas of law and governance.

Some common law traditions are no longer applicable today because of the development of statutory law and the welfare system. If we compare the situation now with the situation before World War II, it is quite different. Traditionally, the common system is mainly based on customs and precedent, while statutory law does exist but only covers specific and limited aspects.

*Take the anti-trust law in the US as an example. The United States has strong antitrust laws, which historically have been based on the common law principle of "rule of reason." This principle allows judges to evaluate whether a particular business practice or agreement harms competition. However, there's a concern that this approach may no longer be sufficient to protect competition effectively in modern times.*

*Trusts, including bank trusts, were common, but the Supreme Court initially didn't recognize their creation. To address this, Congress enacted new legislation known as the antitrust law. Judges now refer to this law. In 1940, the Clayton Act was created. Common law traditionally relied heavily on judicial decisions with limited statutory law, but today, there is more statutory law involved.*

> In the US, antitrust law comprises mainly federal statutes aimed at regulating business conduct and organization to foster competition and prevent unjustified monopolies. The "rule of reason" is a legal doctrine used to interpret the Sherman Antitrust Act, a cornerstone of US antitrust law. The Supreme Court has affirmed that analysis under the rule of reason should focus on the economic consequences of a restraint rather than its social implications.

*History of antitrust laws:*

> The antitrust laws in the United States were enacted over a period of time through several key pieces of legislation. The foundation of modern antitrust law in the U.S. was laid in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to concerns about monopolistic practices and unfair competition. Here are some significant milestones in the development of antitrust laws in the U.S.:
>
> 1. **Sherman Antitrust Act (1890)**: Enacted in 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act was the first federal law to address anticompetitive behavior and prohibit certain business practices that restrain trade or monopolize markets. It declared illegal any contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade and monopolization, as well as attempts to monopolize.
>
> 2. **Clayton Antitrust Act (1914)**: Passed in 1914, the Clayton Antitrust Act expanded upon the Sherman Act and provided additional regulations aimed at preventing anticompetitive practices and protecting competition. It addressed issues such as price discrimination, exclusive dealing, and interlocking directorates.
>
> 3. **Federal Trade Commission Act (1914)**: Also enacted in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission Act created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as an independent agency responsible for enforcing antitrust laws and promoting fair competition. The FTC has authority to investigate and take action against unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
>
> 4. **Robinson-Patman Act (1936)**: The Robinson-Patman Act, passed in 1936, amended the Clayton Antitrust Act and addressed discriminatory pricing practices that harm competition. It prohibits certain forms of price discrimination, such as charging different prices to different buyers when the effect may substantially lessen competition.
>
> 5. **Celler-Kefauver Act (1950)**: The Celler-Kefauver Act, passed in 1950, amended the Clayton Act and strengthened antitrust enforcement by addressing anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions. It expanded the scope of review for mergers and prohibited acquisitions that substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.
>
> These laws, along with subsequent amendments and judicial interpretations, form the framework of modern antitrust regulation in the United States. They aim to promote competition, protect consumers, and ensure a level playing field in the marketplace.

*Clayton Act:*

> The creation of antitrust laws in the United States, particularly the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, involved a complex interplay between the legislative and judicial branches, including the Supreme Court.
>
> Prior to the enactment of the Clayton Act, there was growing concern about the concentration of economic power and the rise of monopolistic practices in various industries. However, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the first major federal antitrust law, had limitations and ambiguities that led to challenges in its enforcement.
>
> The Supreme Court played a significant role in shaping antitrust jurisprudence through its interpretation of the Sherman Act in various cases. Notably, the Court's decision in Standard Oil Co. v. United States (1911) and United States v. American Tobacco Co. (1911) established important precedents regarding the application of antitrust laws to monopolistic practices and restraint of trade.
>
> However, despite these rulings, there were calls for stronger and more comprehensive antitrust legislation to address emerging anticompetitive practices. In response to these concerns, Congress passed the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914, which expanded on the principles of the Sherman Act and addressed certain deficiencies identified by the Supreme Court.
>
> The Clayton Act contained provisions aimed at prohibiting specific anticompetitive behaviors such as price discrimination, exclusive dealing, and tying arrangements. It also established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce antitrust laws and promote fair competition.
>
> While the Supreme Court continued to interpret and apply antitrust laws in subsequent cases, the Clayton Act represented a legislative effort to strengthen antitrust enforcement and provide clearer guidelines for addressing anticompetitive conduct in the marketplace.
>
> Overall, the creation of the Clayton Antitrust Act involved a collaborative effort between Congress and the Supreme Court, with both branches playing important roles in shaping the development of antitrust law in the United States.

In Britain, before Brexit, statutory law came from European directives.

> Before Brexit, the United Kingdom (UK) was a member of the European Union (EU), and as such, EU directives played a significant role in shaping UK statutory law. EU directives are legislative acts that set out specific objectives that EU member states are required to achieve through their national laws. Member states have the flexibility to implement these directives into their national legal systems, which often involves passing new statutory laws or amending existing ones to comply with EU requirements. Therefore, EU directives had a direct influence on UK statutory law prior to Brexit.

In the UK, private bills were commonly used during the 19th century for several purposes. They were employed to establish corporations, grant monopolies, and address specific concerns of individuals within Parliament. Today, private bills are still utilized, especially for large infrastructure projects. These bills affect only a small group of people or organizations, focusing on matters that are specific to them rather than the general public.

> In the UK, a private bill is a type of legislation introduced in Parliament that affects specific individuals, organizations, or entities, rather than the general public. These bills typically address private or localized matters, such as granting powers or privileges to particular parties, authorizing activities with limited impact beyond a small group of stakeholders, or addressing individual grievances or interests. Private bills are distinct from public bills, which apply to the general population or the entire country. The process for introducing and passing private bills involves special procedures and may require scrutiny by select committees to ensure fairness and transparency.
